{"id": "95cf29f06be847ff_summary", "displayed_text": "Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.<br><hr><br><p>Overall, the comments reflect a predominantly negative view of cutting academic funding, with a small minority expressing conditional support or uncertainty. The majority of responses emphasize that such cuts would harm education, research, and long-term societal progress. Education is widely seen as a foundational pillar for other professions and innovation, with concerns that reductions would disadvantage students, educators, and the country's global competitiveness. Some specifically mention impacts on low-income students and adult learners, as well as risks like researcher emigration and reduced safety in schools. A minority suggest that funding cuts might be justified due to perceived political biases in academia, though even these responses express reservations about stifling independent thought. A small percentage indicate insufficient knowledge to form an opinion, while others cautiously assume there might be underlying reasons for the cuts but stress the need for alternative solutions to avoid declining educational quality. The overarching sentiment is that investing in education is beneficial and necessary for societal stability and advancement.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
