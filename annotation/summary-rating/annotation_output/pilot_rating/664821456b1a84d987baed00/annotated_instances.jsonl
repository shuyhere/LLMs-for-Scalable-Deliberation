Commentators argued that such cuts are detrimental to the future of the country, viewing education as the foundational pillar for all other professions and a key driver of societal success.</p>\n<p>Several key concerns were raised:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impact on Students and Equity:</strong> Many believe the cuts are unfair to students, including children and adults seeking to further their education. A specific concern was that it would harm students who cannot afford college without financial support.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic and Scientific Competitiveness:</strong> There is a strong belief that reducing funding will stifle research and innovation, leading to a \"brain drain\" of researchers to competitor nations and weakening the country's long-term competitiveness.</li>\n<li><strong>Societal Decline:</strong> Some view the policy as short-sighted, arguing that underfunding schools will limit resources, lower the quality of education, and ultimately set up the nation for future failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A minority of views offered more nuance.
