This could lead to identity theft, fraud, and unwanted surveillance.</p>\n<p>Another significant concern is personal safety. Anonymity is seen as a crucial tool for protecting individuals from real-world harm, such as doxxing, stalking, and harassment. Many believe that using a real name could expose them to retaliation for their opinions, potentially costing them their jobs or endangering them, especially for those in vulnerable situations like victims of domestic abuse or individuals with unpopular political views.

The core belief is that anonymity enables negative behavior.

Proponents argue this would reduce online toxicity and make social media safer, particularly by helping to eliminate bots, prevent impersonation, and protect minors from predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Nuanced and Conditional Views:</strong>\nSeveral comments offered a middle-ground perspective. Some suggested a compromise where users verify their identity on the backend with the platform but are still allowed to use a pseudonym publicly. This would allow platforms to take action against malicious users while still preserving public anonymity. Others proposed an optional verification system, where users who choose to register with their real identity receive a badge or checkmark, allowing others to distinguish between anonymous and verified accounts. A few noted their support would depend on whether the requirement came from the platform itself or from the government, expressing more distrust toward a government mandate.</p>", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "summary_length": NaN, "displayed_text": "Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.<br><hr><br><p>Based on the comments provided, here is an overall summary:</p>\n<p>There are strong and divergent views on requiring real-name registration for social media.
