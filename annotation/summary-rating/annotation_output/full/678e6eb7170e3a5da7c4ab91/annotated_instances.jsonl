This would make tips a truly optional bonus rather than a necessity for workers' survival.</p>\n<p>There is a strong sentiment against the expansion of \"tipping culture,\" particularly the feeling of being pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping for minimal-service or basic transactions, often through digital payment screens. Many feel that tipping should be reserved as a voluntary reward for excellent service, not a mandatory or forced obligation. While some would like to see the tipping system eliminated entirely, others see its value as a way to show appreciation.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improving the system included changing the standard from percentages to fixed dollar amounts and creating a reciprocal system where a customer who tips might receive a small token of appreciation, like a thank-you note or a coupon for a future visit.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 50s "}}
