Many feel that the constant need to upgrade leads to planned obsolescence, unnecessary spending, and environmental waste. Some users report frustration with the frequency of updates, which can introduce bugs or render older devices incompatible with new software. There is also a perception that companies prioritize profit over product longevity, releasing new models with only minor improvements to encourage frequent purchases.</p>\n<p>A common theme is the desire for a more balanced approach\u2014where innovation is still encouraged, but with a focus on sustainability, repairability, and longer-lasting devices.
