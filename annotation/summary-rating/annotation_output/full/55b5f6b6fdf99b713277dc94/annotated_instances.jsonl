The most prevalent argument is that healthcare should be a fundamental human right, not a luxury contingent on income or employment. Many participants feel it is a moral and essential duty of the government to care for the well-being of its citizens, ensuring that no one has to choose between their health and other basic necessities.</p>\n<p>The high cost and inaccessibility of the current healthcare system are central to this support. Commenters described the existing system as \"wildly expensive\" and \"prohibitive,\" leading to financial hardship and forcing people to forgo necessary medical care. Several participants pointed to other developed nations with universal healthcare as successful models the U.S. should emulate, expressing that the country is falling behind in this regard. The belief is that a government-provided system would be more equitable, efficient, and lead to better overall public health outcomes.</p>\n<p>While the support is strong, some participants offered nuanced or conditional approval. A portion of supporters emphasized the importance of choice, advocating for a public option to exist alongside private insurance rather than a complete replacement. Others conditioned their support on the system's ability to provide care in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments expressed opposition to government-provided healthcare. The primary reasons cited were a belief in the inefficiency of government-run programs, concerns that quality of care would suffer compared to the private sector, and a philosophical objection to increasing citizens' dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}
