Supporters argue that it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, and help prevent harmful behaviors such as impersonation, misinformation, and scams. Some emphasize the importance of verified identities in combating bots and ensuring authenticity. A few also highlight the potential for real-name systems to enhance safety for minors and prevent predatory behavior. Others see it as a way to encourage responsible online behavior by making users more conscious of their actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposing Real-Name Registration:</strong>\nAbout 50% of the comments are in opposition. Opponents raise concerns about privacy, noting that requiring real names could expose users to doxxing, stalking, harassment, and identity theft. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression, especially for vulnerable groups such as victims of domestic abuse, political dissidents, or individuals in repressive environments. Others point out that real-name policies could be exploited by governments or corporations for surveillance or censorship. Some users also feel that anonymity allows for a safer and more open online discourse.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral or Conditional Stances:</strong>\nThe remaining comments reflect a more nuanced or conditional view. Some argue that real-name registration could be optional or that users should have the choice to remain anonymous while still maintaining a level of verification for accountability. Others suggest that a middle ground\u2014such as verified identities with pseudonyms\u2014might offer the best balance between privacy and safety. A few commenters acknowledge the potential benefits of real-name systems but express skepticism about enforcement and the likelihood of compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Concerns Across All Perspectives:</strong>\n- <strong>Privacy and Data Security:</strong> Many commenters, regardless of stance, highlight the risks of personal information being stored or misused by platforms or third parties.\n- <strong>Safety and Anonymity:</strong> A significant portion of the discussion revolves around the safety implications of anonymity versus real-name policies, particularly for marginalized or vulnerable users.\n- <strong>Accountability and Misinformation:</strong> Supporters often focus on the need to reduce harmful content and increase responsibility among users.\n- <strong>Trust in Platforms:</strong> Several commenters express distrust in social media companies to handle personal data responsibly or enforce real-name policies fairly.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>\nThe comments illustrate a complex and multifaceted debate. While some see real-name registration as a necessary tool for improving accountability and reducing harmful behavior online, others view it as a threat to privacy, freedom of expression, and personal safety. The discussion underscores the tension between the need for transparency and the right to anonymity in the digital space. Many commenters advocate for a balanced approach that respects both privacy and safety, suggesting that solutions may lie in flexible verification systems rather than rigid real-name requirements.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "qwen3-32b", "num_samples_group": 70, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>The comments reflect a wide range of perspectives on the issue of requiring real-name registration on social media platforms, with a general split between those who support it for increased accountability and safety, and those who oppose it due to privacy concerns and the risks associated with exposing personal information.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Real-Name Registration:</strong>\nApproximately 40% of the comments express support for real-name registration.
