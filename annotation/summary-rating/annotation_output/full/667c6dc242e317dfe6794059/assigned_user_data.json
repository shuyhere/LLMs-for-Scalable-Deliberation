These supporters emphasize that such measures are necessary to protect public health, prevent disease spread, and save lives. Many reference the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of why these powers are important, noting how lack of compliance slowed recovery and prolonged restrictions.

Many specifically object to mandatory vaccinations, arguing that people should have the right to make their own medical decisions. Several respondents cite concerns about vaccine safety, particularly referencing COVID-19 vaccines that they believe were developed too quickly without adequate long-term testing.
