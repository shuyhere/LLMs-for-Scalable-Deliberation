There is a shared frustration with the expansion of tipping culture, with many feeling that prompts to tip for small transactions or minimal service are an \"overkill.\" This has led to a sense that tipping is becoming forced or that customers are being pressured into it, particularly through digital payment screens.</p>\n<p>Consequently, many feel that tipping should be voluntary and based on the quality of service provided, rather than a mandatory or expected obligation. While some advocate for getting rid of the tipping system entirely, others proposed unique changes. These alternative ideas include shifting from percentages to fixed-dollar amounts or implementing a system where a customer receives a small token of appreciation, such as a thank you note or a coupon, in exchange for a tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
