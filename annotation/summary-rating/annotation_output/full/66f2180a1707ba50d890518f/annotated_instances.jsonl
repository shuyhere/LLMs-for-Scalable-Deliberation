A substantial percentage of individuals feel that AI has made their personal and professional tasks easier, faster, and more streamlined. Common benefits cited include assistance with research, summarizing large amounts of information, drafting emails and documents, planning events, and correcting writing. Many view AI as a powerful tool for learning, creativity, and problem-solving, using it to generate new ideas, create art, learn new skills, and get quick answers to complex questions. Some also find personal value in AI for offering advice and emotional support.</p>\n<p>However, these benefits are accompanied by significant concerns. A recurring theme is a growing mistrust of online content, with individuals expressing anxiety about their ability to distinguish between human-created and AI-generated art, writing, and images. Privacy is another major concern, with many worried about how their personal data is being collected and used. Fears about job security and the potential for AI to replace human workers were also frequently mentioned.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, some express a more ambivalent or negative view. These individuals worry about becoming over-reliant on AI, which they feel could diminish critical thinking skills and originality. A smaller portion of people feel that AI has not yet changed their lives in a meaningful way, viewing it as more of an optional tool or a form of entertainment.</p>\n<p>In summary, while AI is widely embraced as a practical tool that enhances productivity and simplifies tasks, this enthusiasm is tempered by strong reservations about its impact on authenticity, privacy, job security, and human skills.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 12m 38s "}}
