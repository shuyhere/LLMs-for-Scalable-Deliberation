The most frequently cited reason is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many feel it is the government's duty and responsibility to care for its population's well-being.</p>\n<p>Supporters frequently point to the current system's failures, describing healthcare as \"wildly expensive,\" \"prohibitive,\" and a source of significant financial strain and medical debt. They argue that a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes by increasing access to preventative care, which could catch illnesses earlier. Several commenters compared the United States unfavorably to other developed nations that have universal healthcare, viewing the U.S. as lagging behind. The idea that a healthy population is essential for a competitive workforce and national security was also raised.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of commenters expressed opposition to the idea. Their primary concerns centered on government inefficiency, waste, and the belief that a government-run system would lead to a lower quality of care, longer wait times, and be too costly for taxpayers. Some also voiced a philosophical objection to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n<p>A number of participants offered conditional or nuanced support. Several advocated for a \"public option\" that would exist alongside private insurance, preserving individual choice. Others supported the idea but with specific conditions, such as ensuring that care is administered in a timely manner. A few comments also raised questions about eligibility, suggesting that such a benefit should be restricted to citizens or taxpayers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}
