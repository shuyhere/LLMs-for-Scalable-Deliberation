Many suggest that the system should be abolished in favor of employers paying a <strong>livable wage</strong>, which would eliminate the need for customers to subsidize employee pay. Others criticize the <strong>overextension of tipping culture</strong>, where tips are expected for minimal or no service (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping as a Reward for Service</strong><br />\n   A portion of the comments support tipping as a <strong>voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service</strong>. These individuals believe that tipping should be based on the <strong>quality of service</strong> and not be mandatory. They emphasize that tips should be given when a service exceeds expectations, not as a substitute for fair wages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Intrusive Tipping</strong><br />\n   Many commenters express frustration with <strong>forced tipping prompts</strong> on digital payment systems and the <strong>pressure to tip before receiving service</strong>. There is a desire for more <strong>transparent and optional</strong> tipping practices, especially in situations where tipping is not appropriate or expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Low Wages and Employer Responsibility</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the belief that <strong>employers should be responsible for paying a fair wage</strong>, and that tipping should not be used to justify underpayment.
