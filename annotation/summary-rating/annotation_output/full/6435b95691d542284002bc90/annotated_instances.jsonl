Here is a summary of the key themes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Opposition to the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   A significant portion of the comments express strong opposition to the tipping system, arguing that it places undue financial pressure on consumers and creates an unfair burden on service workers. Many suggest that the system should be abolished in favor of employers paying a <strong>livable wage</strong>, which would eliminate the need for customers to subsidize employee pay. Others criticize the <strong>overextension of tipping culture</strong>, where tips are expected for minimal or no service (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping as a Reward for Service</strong><br />\n   A portion of the comments support tipping as a <strong>voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service</strong>. These individuals believe that tipping should be based on the <strong>quality of service</strong> and not be mandatory. They emphasize that tips should be given when a service exceeds expectations, not as a substitute for fair wages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Intrusive Tipping</strong><br />\n   Many commenters express frustration with <strong>forced tipping prompts</strong> on digital payment systems and the <strong>pressure to tip before receiving service</strong>. There is a desire for more <strong>transparent and optional</strong> tipping practices, especially in situations where tipping is not appropriate or expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Low Wages and Employer Responsibility</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the belief that <strong>employers should be responsible for paying a fair wage</strong>, and that tipping should not be used to justify underpayment. Several commenters reference the <strong>U.S. tipped minimum wage</strong> as a problematic policy and advocate for <strong>eliminating the two-tiered wage system</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suggestions for Reform</strong><br />\n   Proposed reforms include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Implementing a <strong>flat service fee</strong> (e.g., 10%) to replace tipping.</li>\n<li>Adopting a <strong>European-style system</strong>, where employees are paid a fair wage and tipping is not expected.</li>\n<li>Ensuring that <strong>tips are not taxed</strong> and are given voluntarily.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limiting tipping to <strong>full-service establishments</strong> where tipping is appropriate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Regional Perspectives</strong><br />\n   Some commenters note that tipping is <strong>not universal</strong> and that in other countries, it is either <strong>optional or non-existent</strong>. This highlights the <strong>cultural norms</strong> that shape tipping behavior and the potential for change based on different economic models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moral and Ethical Views</strong><br />\n   There is a moral dimension to many of the comments, with some arguing that <strong>tipping should not be used to judge or pressure workers</strong>, and that it should be a <strong>kind and voluntary act</strong>, not a financial obligation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the tipping system is widely viewed as <strong>flawed, inconsistent, and often unfair</strong>. While some support tipping as a way to reward good service, the majority believe that <strong>employers should bear the responsibility of ensuring fair compensation</strong>, and that the current system should be reformed or eliminated.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 49s "}}
