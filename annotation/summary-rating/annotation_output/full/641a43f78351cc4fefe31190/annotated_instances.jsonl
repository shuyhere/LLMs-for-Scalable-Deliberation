The most prevalent concern was that tariffs would be passed on to consumers, leading to increased prices for everyday goods, a higher cost of living, and reduced spending power. Many felt this would disproportionately harm middle-class and low-income families, as well as small businesses that rely on imported goods. Other common arguments against the policy included that it would damage international relations, lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, create economic instability, and ultimately fail to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>However, a notable portion of participants believe the policy will have a positive impact, particularly in the long term. Supporters argued that the tariffs are a necessary measure to correct unfair trade practices by other countries and to make American products more competitive. They see it as a way to generate revenue for the U.S. and strengthen the domestic economy. Some expressed confidence in the administration's business strategy, viewing the current economic strain as a temporary phase that will lead to future prosperity and better trade deals.</p>\n<p>A smaller group offered a more nuanced perspective, suggesting the effects are mixed. These commentators acknowledged that while tariffs might protect certain domestic industries, they also create uncertainty and raise costs for consumers and other businesses. Several pointed out a distinction between negative short-term consequences and potential long-term benefits.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 8s "}}
