Many commenters note that tariffs function as taxes that companies pass on to consumers, leading to higher costs for everyday goods and essential items. Several mention experiencing these effects firsthand, with some small business owners reporting difficulties sourcing materials and products due to increased costs. The concern extends beyond individual purchases to broader economic indicators, with multiple respondents warning about potential recession risks and reduced consumer spending power.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on Long-term Benefits</h3>\n<p>Those supporting the tariff policy generally frame it as a necessary correction to address trade imbalances and protect American interests. Supporters argue that previous trade arrangements disadvantaged the U.S., and that tariffs will generate revenue for the treasury while encouraging domestic production. Several commenters express confidence in the business acumen behind the policy, suggesting that short-term difficulties may be worth enduring for future economic strengthening.</p>\n<h3>Impact on International Relations</h3>\n<p>Many respondents worry about the deterioration of international trade relationships, particularly with key partners like Canada and China. Comments highlight concerns about retaliatory measures from other countries and the potential isolation of the U.S. from global trade networks. Some fear this approach damages America's reputation as a reliable trading partner and could lead to long-term diplomatic consequences.</p>\n<h3>Mixed Assessments and Uncertainty</h3>\n<p>A notable segment of commenters acknowledge the complexity of the issue, suggesting that outcomes may vary across different industries and timeframes. Some express cautious optimism that initial negative impacts might eventually lead to beneficial trade renegotiations, while others remain skeptical about whether promised benefits will materialize. Several respondents indicate they lack expertise to fully evaluate the policy but trust economic experts who have expressed concerns.</p>\n<h3>Small Business and Consumer Perspectives</h3>\n<p>Small business owners feature prominently among those reporting immediate negative impacts, citing difficulties with supply chains and increased operational costs. Consumers express frustration about rising prices across various product categories, with particular concern about the affordability of essential goods. The sentiment that working families will bear the brunt of these policies appears throughout the comments, with many noting that even dual-income households struggle with increased costs.</p>\n<p>The overall tone of the comments reflects significant anxiety about economic stability, with divergent views on whether short-term pain will lead to long-term gain or simply result in sustained economic hardship for American consumers and businesses.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "num_samples_group": 70, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><h2>Summary of Comments on Current Tariff Policy</h2>\n<p>The comments reveal deeply divided perspectives on the current tariff policy under the Trump administration, with opinions split between those who see potential long-term benefits and those who anticipate significant negative consequences.</p>\n<h3>Economic Impact Concerns</h3>\n<p>A substantial portion of respondents express concern about the immediate economic effects, particularly regarding price increases.
