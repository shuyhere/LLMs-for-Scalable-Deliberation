Many voice a desire to eliminate the system entirely, citing concerns over its expansion into non-traditional transactions and the perceived pressure to tip, which some describe as a form of bullying.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments advocate for a fundamental shift in responsibility, arguing that employers should pay a livable wage instead of relying on customer tips to subsidize workers' incomes. This is seen as a way to reduce the financial burden and social pressure on customers.</p>\n<p>There is also support for maintaining a voluntary tipping system that rewards exceptional service rather than being an expected part of every transaction. Some suggest practical modifications, such as moving from percentage-based tips to fixed amounts or offering tangible rewards like thank-you notes or coupons to incentivize tipping.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward major reform, with an emphasis on reducing obligation and ensuring fair compensation from employers rather than customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}
