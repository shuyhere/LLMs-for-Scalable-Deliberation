Many argue that anonymity is essential for individuals in vulnerable situations, such as those experiencing domestic abuse or political repression, and that requiring real names could expose users to <strong>harassment</strong>, <strong>job risks</strong>, or <strong>violence</strong>. Others worry about the <strong>misuse of personal data</strong> by platforms or governments, including the potential for surveillance or data breaches.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a portion of the comments <strong>support</strong> real-name registration as a means to increase <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>reduce cyberbullying</strong>, and <strong>prevent impersonation or fraudulent behavior</strong>. Supporters believe that tying real identities to online activity could improve <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>credibility</strong>, and help <strong>combat harmful content</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some commenters adopt a <strong>nuanced stance</strong>, acknowledging both the benefits and risks. They suggest <strong>optional real-name registration</strong>, <strong>verified identities with indicators like checkmarks</strong>, or <strong>differentiated rules</strong> depending on the platform or the nature of the user's activity.
