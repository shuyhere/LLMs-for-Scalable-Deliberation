A majority of commenters view education as a foundational pillar of society, and they believe that reducing its funding is a short-sighted policy that would be detrimental to the country's future.</p>\n<p>Concerns were raised that such cuts would harm students, educators, and adults seeking to further their education by limiting resources and opportunities. Specific worries included hindering innovation, weakening the nation's long-term competitiveness, and causing a \"brain drain\" of researchers to competitor countries. The negative impact on students who cannot afford higher education was also a significant concern.</p>\n<p>However, not all views were entirely negative. A minority of comments expressed more nuanced perspectives. One person suggested there might be some justification for cuts due to a perceived political bias in academic institutions, while also worrying that it could stifle independent thinking. Another commenter expressed conditional trust that an alternative solution would be provided to prevent a decline in educational quality.</p>\n<p>Finally, some participants indicated they did not have enough information about the policy to form an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}
