Some commenters worry about the psychological impact on both creators and audiences, citing issues like mental health, algorithmic pressures, and the promotion of consumerism. There is also apprehension about the profession's sustainability and the perception of it being an \"easy\" career path, with calls for greater accountability, transparency, and media literacy.</p>\n<p>A smaller segment expresses strong skepticism or negativity, describing influencers as inauthentic, attention-seeking, or socially detrimental. Despite these criticisms, many recognize the effort and skill involved in content creation, validating it as a legitimate, albeit challenging, profession shaped by digital evolution.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}
