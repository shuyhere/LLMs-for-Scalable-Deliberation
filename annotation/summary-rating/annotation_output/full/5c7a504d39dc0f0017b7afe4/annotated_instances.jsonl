The most prevalent argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and should be accessible to all regardless of income or employment status. Many believe it is the government's duty and responsibility to care for its citizens' well-being.</p>\n<p>Participants frequently pointed to the current system's failures, citing the prohibitive cost of insurance and care, which leads to medical debt, bankruptcy, and people forgoing necessary treatment. Several commenters compared the U.S. unfavorably to other developed nations that have universal healthcare systems, expressing that the U.S. is lagging behind. The potential benefits of a government-provided system were also highlighted, including better public health outcomes through preventative care, a healthier and more competitive workforce, and a more efficient system overall.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some commenters offered conditional support. A notable portion advocated for a \"public option\" that would exist alongside private insurance to preserve consumer choice. Others expressed that their support depends on the system being able to provide care in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A small minority opposed the idea. Their primary concerns centered on government inefficiency, wastefulness, and the belief that a government-run system would lead to a lower quality of care, longer wait times, and be too costly for taxpayers. These participants argued that healthcare is better left to the private sector and expressed a philosophical opposition to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 37s "}}
