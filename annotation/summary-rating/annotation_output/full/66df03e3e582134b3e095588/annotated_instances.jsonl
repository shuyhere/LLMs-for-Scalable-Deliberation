A majority of comments express frustration with \"tipping creep,\" where requests for tips have expanded to nearly every transaction, including minimal-service situations like picking up coffee or takeout food. Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" by modern point-of-sale tablets that often default to a tip option.</p>\n<p>The most frequently cited root cause of this issue is the practice of employers paying low, non-livable wages, which shifts the responsibility of employee compensation onto the customer. A significant percentage of participants believe that tipping has become a way for businesses to subsidize their payroll.</p>\n<p>In response, the most popular proposed solution is to abolish the current tipping system entirely. This would be replaced by a model where employers are required to pay their staff a fair, livable wage, even if it results in higher menu prices. Several people pointed to systems in Europe or Japan, which often use a fixed service charge or simply pay workers a higher base salary, as better alternatives.</p>\n<p>While the desire for major change is clear, there is also a strong belief that tipping, in principle, should be a voluntary reward for excellent service, not an obligation. Many feel the current system has detached tipping from service quality, making it feel mandatory regardless of the experience. Some participants still value the ability to show extra appreciation for outstanding service and would want tipping to remain a truly optional act of gratitude.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 24s "}}
