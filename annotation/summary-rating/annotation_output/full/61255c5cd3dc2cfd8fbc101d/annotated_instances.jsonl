S, citizens since the importers will pass the cost along to consumers.  Second, foreign economies will adjust to the tariffs by opening up trade with other countries like China.  This lead to shortages of goods and that too will lead to higher prices."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 20s "}}
