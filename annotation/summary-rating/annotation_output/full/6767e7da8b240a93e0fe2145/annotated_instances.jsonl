Many worried about reduced resources for learning, larger class sizes, cuts to extracurricular activities, and overall decline in education quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Innovation</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents highlighted concerns about halted medical and scientific research, with specific mentions of cancer research and other innovations that save lives and money. Many feared that researchers would leave for countries with better funding, undermining America's competitive advantage in science and technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term National Consequences</strong>\nNumerous comments focused on the strategic disadvantage this creates for America's future, including workforce skill gaps, reduced global competitiveness, and the weakening of the country's position in education compared to other nations. Several noted that investing in education typically yields positive returns for society.</p>\n<p><strong>Political Motivations</strong>\nMany respondents perceived the cuts as politically motivated, with some viewing it as an attempt to control or punish institutions that disagree with Trump's policies. Several characterized it as authoritarian behavior designed to keep the population less educated and more easily controlled.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Views</strong>\nA small minority supported the cuts, citing concerns about:\n- Misuse of funding by educational institutions\n- Universities promoting \"leftist\" or \"woke\" ideologies\n- High costs of education and student debt\n- Belief that education should be managed at state and local levels\n- Opposition to DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Impacts</strong>\nSome respondents shared direct personal consequences, including lost research funding, concern for family members in college, and reduced income from academic studies.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect deep concern that cutting academic funding represents a short-sighted policy that will have lasting negative impacts on American society, education, research, and global competitiveness.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}
