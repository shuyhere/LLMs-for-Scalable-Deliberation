Furthermore, their integrity, or lack thereof influences my opinion as well. I don't like people that are clearly just in it for money and don't offer anything new or refreshing, or take advantage of their audience and position. I think it becoming increasingly recognized as a profession is a slippery slope, because people will start to do anything in order to get views so they  can become one. This may lead to crimes or mentally/physically harmful behaviors. I only like a very small few of creators.

Many appreciate that this profession democratizes content creation, allowing everyday people to build platforms and earn income without traditional gatekeepers.

However, opinions diverge on whether it should be considered a primary career path. Many suggest it's better suited as a side venture rather than a main profession, given the high risk and luck factor involved in achieving success.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibility and Regulation</strong></p>\n<p>A recurring theme emphasizes the need for influencers to act responsibly given their impact on audiences. Respondents call for:\n- Greater accountability and transparency, especially regarding sponsored content\n- Media literacy education for viewers\n- Professional standards and potentially regulatory frameworks</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The comments reflect broader anxieties about digital culture, with some viewing the rise of influencers as symptomatic of societal fragmentation or narcissism. Others see it as simply the latest iteration of entertainment professions, comparable to traditional media careers but adapted for the digital age.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the profession has gained recognition and legitimacy, public opinion remains mixed, with support tempered by concerns about sustainability, authenticity, and societal impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 11s "}}
