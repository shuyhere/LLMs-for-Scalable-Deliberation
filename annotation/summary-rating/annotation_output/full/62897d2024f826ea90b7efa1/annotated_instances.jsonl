A significant portion of the comments express opposition to mandatory real-name policies, emphasizing the importance of online anonymity for privacy, freedom of expression, and protection from potential misuse of personal data. Concerns were raised about government surveillance, data exploitation by companies, and the risks associated with exposing personal identities in an environment where political or controversial views may lead to real-world consequences.</p>\n<p>Supporters of real-name requirements argue that such policies could increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, and discourage harmful behavior online. Some commenters acknowledged both sides of the issue, recognizing the potential benefits of real-name systems while also valuing the right to remain anonymous as a form of digital freedom.</p>\n<p>A few commenters noted that the entity enforcing the policy (e.g., the platform vs. the government) significantly influences their stance, with more trust placed in private companies than in governmental authorities. Overall, the discussion highlights the tension between accountability and privacy in the digital space.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
