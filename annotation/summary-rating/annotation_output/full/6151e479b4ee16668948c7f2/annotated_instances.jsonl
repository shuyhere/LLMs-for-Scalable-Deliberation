About half express unqualified support, while around one-third support it with conditions.

Some also note potential benefits such as cultural diversity and revitalizing rural areas.</li>\n<li>Common conditions among supporters: Rigorous vetting and background checks; clear definitions of refugee status; exclusion of criminals and economic migrants; limits or caps to match capacity; ensuring minimal negative impacts on citizens\u2019 resources and the economy; and support for integration (civics education, skills training, strategic resettlement including less-populated areas).</li>\n<li>Concerns and opposition themes: Fiscal strain, debt, crowding, and pressure on social services; prioritizing citizens\u2019 needs first; perceptions of unfairness in benefits; preference that refugees seek protection in neighboring countries; and a view that the U.S. should accept only in extreme circumstances or when the economy can absorb newcomers.</li>\n<li>Points of convergence: Broad agreement on the need for careful vetting and clear eligibility criteria; many who are cautious still back limited or conditional acceptance.
