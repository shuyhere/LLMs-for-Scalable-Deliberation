Many of the people who were for the tariffs were under the false impression that the other countries would be the ones paying the increase. It's paid by U.S importers, that then raise prices for consumers to make up the difference. Tariffs are supposed to incentivize buying and producing within the US, but we don't have the manufacturing ability in this case, or a workforce willing to go through what workers in say, china, go through."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 27s "}}

Overall, the sentiment leans more toward a negative impact, with several key themes emerging from the discussion.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments highlight concerns about <strong>increased prices for consumers</strong> and the <strong>burden of tariffs being passed down to everyday Americans</strong>. Many argue that while tariffs may generate short-term revenue or protect certain industries, the long-term effects include <strong>rising inflation</strong>, <strong>reduced consumer spending</strong>, and <strong>economic hardship for middle- and lower-income households</strong>. There is also a common concern that tariffs are not effectively <strong>bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</strong>, as companies often absorb or pass on the costs rather than reshore operations.</p>\n<p>Another recurring theme is the <strong>impact on international trade relationships</strong>. Many commenters express worry that the aggressive and unilateral nature of the tariff policy is <strong>damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable trade partner</strong> and may provoke retaliatory measures from other countries. This could lead to <strong>trade wars</strong>, <strong>disrupted global supply chains</strong>, and <strong>reduced economic cooperation</strong> on a global scale.</p>\n<p>Some contributors acknowledge <strong>mixed or long-term benefits</strong>, suggesting that the policy could eventually <strong>stabilize the economy</strong>, <strong>reduce trade deficits</strong>, or <strong>encourage domestic production</strong>. A few also point to <strong>positive outcomes such as increased tax revenue</strong> or <strong>greater awareness of unfair trade practices</strong> by other nations. However, these optimistic views are often tempered by the belief that <strong>any benefits will be slow to materialize</strong> and may not outweigh the immediate costs.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters also emphasize the <strong>negative effects on small businesses</strong>, which are often <strong>disproportionately impacted</strong> by the uncertainty and increased costs associated with tariffs. Some note that <strong>companies are finding ways to work around the tariffs</strong>, which limits their intended economic impact.</p>\n<p>In summary, while a minority of comments express a positive outlook\u2014often tied to long-term goals or the belief that the U.S. has been historically disadvantaged in trade\u2014<strong>the majority of the feedback reflects a negative or mixed assessment</strong>. Concerns about <strong>consumer costs, inflation, international relations, and the effectiveness of the policy</strong> dominate the discussion, with many concluding that the current tariff policy is more harmful than beneficial to the U.S. economy and society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 10m 35s "}}
