A smaller share supports targeted or broad cuts due to perceived ideological bias and inefficiency in academia. A few are neutral or say they need more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main concerns about cuts:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Erodes the foundation of education, harms K\u201312 and higher ed, and reduces social mobility.</li>\n<li>Curtails research and innovation (including medical/cancer research), risking brain drain to other countries.</li>\n<li>Weakens the future workforce, widens skill gaps, and undermines national competitiveness and public safety/health outcomes.</li>\n<li>Disproportionately impacts low-income students and adult learners seeking to upskill.</li>\n<li>Could force universities to cut smaller departments and reduce educational quality.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some raise legal concerns if funds were already appropriated by Congress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rationales offered by supporters of cuts:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Belief that universities are politicized (left-leaning/DEI \u201cindoctrination\u201d) and that reductions are a corrective.</li>\n<li>Concern about government inefficiency, misuse of funds by school systems, and the role of federal subsidies in driving tuition inflation; preference for state/local control.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Openness to \u201creasonable\u201d or targeted cuts and broader reform to reduce waste and debt burdens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Motives ascribed:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Critics often see the cuts as politically punitive, authoritarian, or intended to keep the public less informed.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supporters view them as a response to ideological capture within academia and as a national security/values issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nuanced/conditional views:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Some call for balanced reform: trim waste but protect core instruction, student support, and research.</li>\n<li>Desire for clear alternative solutions or reinvestment plans if funds are reduced.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few express uncertainty and request more details before forming an opinion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anticipated impacts if cuts proceed:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Reduced access and opportunity for students, especially from lower-income backgrounds.</li>\n<li>Slower innovation and economic growth; potential loss of talent to better-funded systems abroad.</li>\n<li>Increased strain on universities, with program cuts and diminished ability to attract top scholars.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}
