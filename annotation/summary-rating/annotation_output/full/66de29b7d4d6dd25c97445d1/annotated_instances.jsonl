There was a general consensus that tipping should be based on the quality of service, and that customers should not feel coerced into tipping. Several individuals suggested eliminating mandatory tipping and shifting the responsibility to employers to provide a livable wage, ensuring that workers are not dependent on customer tips for their income.</p>\n<p>Some proposed alternative approaches to the tipping system, such as replacing percentage-based tipping with fixed amounts or offering incentives to customers for tipping, such as thank-you notes or coupons. Others emphasized the importance of allowing flexibility in tipping, especially for those who may not be able to afford large tips but still want to show appreciation for good service.</p>\n<p>While a few respondents indicated that they regularly tip and do not see a problem with the system, they still acknowledged the need for better wage structures for service workers. Overall, the feedback reflects a desire for a more equitable, voluntary, and transparent tipping system that respects both customers and service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 57s "}}
