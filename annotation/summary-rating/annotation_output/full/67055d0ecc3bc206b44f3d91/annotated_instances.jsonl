Some supporters believe it would foster a safer and more authentic online environment, especially for vulnerable groups like minors.</p>\n<p>Opponents raise concerns about privacy infringement, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and increased risks of identity theft, doxxing, or real-world harm. Many emphasize the importance of anonymity for protecting vulnerable individuals (e.g., domestic abuse survivors, marginalized groups, or those with dissenting opinions) and preserving freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express mixed or conditional views, suggesting that real-name registration might be acceptable if implemented by platforms (not governments), kept private in backend systems, or made optional with verification badges for those who choose it. Some acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks, indicating that the issue involves balancing safety and privacy considerations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
