Many emphasize the importance of kindness, the value of every life, and the responsibility of a resource-rich nation to help those in need. Several commenters acknowledge the need for a balanced approach, advocating for thorough vetting processes, integration support, and limits to ensure that existing citizens are not negatively impacted. </p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments oppose accepting more refugees, citing concerns about economic strain, government debt, and the prioritization of helping domestic citizens before taking in others. Some express frustration with current policies, believing they unfairly allocate resources or fail to address the needs of everyday Americans. Overall, while there is a strong undercurrent of compassion and support, many voices also call for careful, thoughtful implementation of refugee policies to maintain social and economic stability.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 6s "}}
