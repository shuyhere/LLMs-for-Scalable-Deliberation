Many express frustration with the proliferation of tipping requests in situations where they were not traditionally expected, such as pickup orders or basic counter service. The prevalence of digital payment systems with prominent tipping prompts has created uncomfortable social pressure, with customers feeling \"bullied\" or coerced into tipping even when no meaningful service has been provided.</p>\n<h6>Preferred Solutions and Reforms</h6>\n<p>The most commonly suggested reform is eliminating the tipping system entirely in favor of employers paying living wages to their workers. Many respondents point to European models where service charges are incorporated into prices and workers receive adequate base compensation. Those who support retaining some form of tipping generally favor making it truly optional and merit-based, rewarding exceptional service rather than subsidizing employer wage costs.</p>\n<p>Several specific improvements were suggested for situations where tipping continues:\n- Clear \"no tip\" options on digital payment screens without multiple steps\n- Tips requested only after service is rendered and can be evaluated\n- Standardized tipping guidelines based on fixed amounts rather than percentages\n- Service charges built into pricing rather than separate tip requests</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Tipping Practice</h6>\n<p>While most comments were critical of the current system, some respondents acknowledged the financial reality for service workers who depend on tips due to sub-minimum wage compensation. A minority of commenters expressed continued support for tipping as a way to show appreciation for good service or to help workers who are underpaid. However, even among those who regularly tip, many view it as an obligation driven by workers' economic needs rather than a genuine reward system.</p>\n<p>The overwhelming consensus suggests that the American tipping system has expanded beyond its original purpose and now serves primarily to shift labor costs from employers to customers, creating an uncomfortable dynamic that satisfies neither workers nor consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}
