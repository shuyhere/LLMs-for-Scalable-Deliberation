Here is a summary of the key themes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Negative Impact (Approximately 65\u201370% of comments):</strong><br />\n   A significant portion of the comments argue that the tariff policy is harming the U.S. economy and society. Concerns include rising consumer prices, inflation, reduced consumer spending, and economic hardship for middle- and lower-income households. Many commenters emphasize that the costs of tariffs are ultimately passed on to consumers, especially when imported goods become more expensive. There is also concern about the negative effects on small businesses and global trade relationships, with some noting that other countries are retaliating or seeking alternative trade partners. Additionally, several commenters point out that the policy is creating uncertainty, reducing investment, and potentially leading to a recession.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Positive Impact (Approximately 15\u201320% of comments):</strong><br />\n   A smaller number of commenters believe the tariff policy will have a positive effect in the long term. They argue that the policy is helping to stabilize the U.S. economy, increase federal revenue, and correct trade imbalances. Some view tariffs as a way to encourage domestic production, reduce the trade deficit, and bring jobs back to the U.S. A few commenters also mention that the policy could lead to better trade deals with other countries in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed or Neutral Impact (Approximately 10\u201315% of comments):</strong><br />\n   Some commenters acknowledge both potential benefits and drawbacks of the tariff policy. They note that while certain domestic industries may benefit, the overall economy could suffer from higher costs and disrupted global supply chains. A few commenters suggest that the effects may depend on how the policy is implemented and whether it leads to long-term structural changes in the economy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Social and Political Concerns:</strong><br />\n   Many commenters express concern about the broader societal implications of the tariff policy, including the portrayal of the U.S. as an aggressive or isolationist power. There is also criticism of the administration's approach, with some suggesting that the policies are self-serving, poorly designed, or inconsistent with economic principles. A few commenters highlight the negative effects on international trade relationships and the potential for long-term damage to U.S. soft power.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Industry-Specific Observations:</strong><br />\n   Several commenters from the logistics, shipping, and small business sectors report firsthand impacts, such as decreased trade volume, higher costs, and reduced consumer demand. These perspectives reinforce the idea that the policy is already having tangible effects on certain segments of the economy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the majority of commenters view the Trump administration's tariff policy as having a negative impact on the U.S. economy and society, primarily due to rising costs, reduced consumer spending, and strained international relations. While a smaller group anticipates long-term benefits, many remain skeptical and emphasize the short-term pain and uncertainty the policy is causing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 6s "}}
