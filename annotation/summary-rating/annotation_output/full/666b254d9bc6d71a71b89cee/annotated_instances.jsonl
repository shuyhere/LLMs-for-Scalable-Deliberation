Several comments explained that companies will simply pass the cost of the tariffs on to their customers, meaning the average American ultimately bears the burden. Other negative impacts mentioned include damaging international relationships, particularly with China, failing to create a significant number of U.S. jobs or reshore industries, and disproportionately harming small businesses. Some view the policy as unstable, potentially leading to a recession, and benefiting only the wealthy.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of participants expressed a positive outlook. Their reasoning centered on the belief that the tariffs are a necessary step to correct unfair trade practices and stabilize the U.S. economy. Some argued that the policy will generate needed revenue and help lift American workers out of poverty. A recurring theme among supporters is the idea of long-term benefits, suggesting that while there may be short-term challenges, the policy will ultimately strengthen the nation's economy.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more mixed or neutral perspective. One participant suggested the policy has both positive and negative effects, protecting some domestic industries while raising costs for consumers. Another felt the policy was largely ineffective, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
