Many contributors express frustration with the expectation to tip for minor transactions and services, and feel pressured by digital prompts and societal norms. There is a shared view that the fundamental responsibility for fair compensation should lie with employers, not customers.</p>\n<p>A significant majority of the commentary advocates for employers to pay a livable base wage, thereby reducing workers' heavy reliance on tips. Tipping is widely supported as a voluntary practice to reward and show appreciation for genuinely good service, rather than a mandatory surcharge. Some suggestions for improvement include moving from percentage-based tips to fixed amounts and offering customers small incentives, like thank-you notes or coupons, for leaving a tip.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback calls for a system where employers ensure fair wages, and tipping returns to its original purpose as a discretionary reward for excellent service, free from pressure and expectation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}
