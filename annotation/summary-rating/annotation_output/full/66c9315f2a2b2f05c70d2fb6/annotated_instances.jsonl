Many feel that tipping requests have become ubiquitous, appearing at every transaction point, creating pressure and discomfort for customers. This \"tip creep\" into basic transactions is viewed as excessive and inappropriate.</p>\n<p>The most prominent theme centers on wages and employer responsibility. Multiple respondents emphasize that businesses should pay livable wages rather than relying on customers to supplement employee income through tips. There's clear consensus that workers shouldn't depend on the uncertainty of tips for their basic livelihood, with several explicitly stating that employers should bear this responsibility.</p>\n<p>Regarding the mechanics of tipping, respondents favor making it voluntary rather than mandatory. The preference is for tipping to return to its original purpose - rewarding exceptional service rather than subsidizing wages. Some suggest the system should be \"free\" and without pressure, allowing customers to tip based on service quality without feeling coerced.</p>\n<p>Creative solutions were also proposed, including providing tangible benefits to customers who tip (such as thank you notes or coupons for future visits) and shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping to ensure more substantial gratuities regardless of bill size.</p>\n<p>While views on complete elimination versus reform vary, there's broad agreement that the current system needs significant change, primarily addressing wage structures and reducing the social pressure associated with tipping in routine transactions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 34s "}}
