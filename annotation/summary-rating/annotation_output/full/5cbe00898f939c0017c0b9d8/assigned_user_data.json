Respondents advocate for employers paying livable wages directly, removing the burden from customers and providing workers with stable income.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform</strong>\nMany propose raising the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour and ensuring all workers receive fair compensation without relying on tips.
