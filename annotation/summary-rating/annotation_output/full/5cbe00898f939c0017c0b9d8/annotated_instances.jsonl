A significant majority express that tipping has become excessive and feels obligatory, even in situations where no direct service is provided. Many commenters believe the core issue is that employers are not paying workers a livable wage, which places the burden of subsidizing income on the customer. There is strong support for abolishing the current system in favor of paying service workers a fair, base hourly wage, thereby making tipping truly optional and reserved for exceptional service. Concerns were also raised about the intrusive nature of digital payment systems that pressure customers to tip. While a minority of commenters support tipping as an incentive for good service, the prevailing opinion is that the system needs a fundamental overhaul to reduce consumer pressure and ensure workers are compensated fairly by their employers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
