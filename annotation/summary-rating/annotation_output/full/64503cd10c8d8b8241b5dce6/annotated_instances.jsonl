Several noted that everyone deserves safety and a chance to rebuild their lives.</p>\n<p><strong>American Values and History</strong>: Numerous comments highlighted that America was built by immigrants and refugees seeking freedom from persecution.

Several mentioned that refugees often become hardworking, grateful citizens who contribute positively to society.</p>\n<p><strong>Accountability</strong>: Multiple respondents noted that the U.S. bears some responsibility for global conflicts through foreign policy decisions and arms sales, making refugee acceptance a form of accountability.</p>\n<h6>Opposition to Accepting Refugees</h6>\n<p>Those opposing increased refugee acceptance raised several concerns:</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and Resource Constraints</strong>: The most common objection centered on America's economic challenges, national debt, and inability to adequately support existing citizens.
