Supporters believe that requiring real identities would significantly reduce cyberbullying, harassment, and online abuse, as people tend to behave more responsibly when their actions can be traced to their real identity.

Many express distrust in social media companies' ability to safeguard personal information and fear that data could be sold to governments or third parties. They worry about potential identity theft, fraud, and real-world consequences such as job loss due to political views or harassment. Critics also highlight the importance of anonymity for vulnerable groups, including domestic abuse victims seeking support, political dissidents, and those in restrictive environments.
