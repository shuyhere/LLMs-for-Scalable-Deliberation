A few respondents express confidence in the administration's business acumen and believe short-term challenges will lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>International Trade and Relations</strong>\nMultiple comments highlight concerns about deteriorating international relationships, particularly with China.

Some express skepticism about the effectiveness of the policies, noting that companies are finding ways to circumvent them.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term vs. Short-term Effects</strong>\nThe comments reflect tension between short-term costs and potential long-term benefits.
