The primary worry centers on increased consumer prices, as businesses pass tariff costs onto customers.

Some participants worried that retaliatory tariffs from other countries could further damage free trade and isolate the U.S. economically.</p>\n<h3>Support for the Policy</h3>\n<p>A smaller but notable portion of participants viewed the tariff policy positively. Supporters argued that tariffs address longstanding trade imbalances where other countries paid minimal tariffs to the U.S. They believe the policy will eventually stabilize the economy, protect domestic industries, and create American jobs. Some acknowledged short-term difficulties but maintained optimism about long-term benefits, suggesting that initial negative impacts are temporary sacrifices for future prosperity.</p>\n<h3>Mixed and Uncertain Perspectives</h3>\n<p>Several participants offered nuanced views, acknowledging both potential benefits and drawbacks. Some suggested that while tariffs might protect certain industries, the overall economic impact remains mixed or uncertain. A few participants noted that companies might find workarounds to the tariff policy, limiting its effectiveness.</p>\n<h3>Overall Assessment</h3>\n<p>The deliberation reflects significant skepticism about the current tariff policy, with most participants anticipating or already experiencing negative consequences through higher prices, business disruptions, and economic uncertainty. While supporters believe in eventual positive outcomes, the prevailing sentiment suggests immediate concerns outweigh potential long-term benefits.
