Many feel that if workers were not dependent on tips to survive, tipping could return to its intended purpose as a voluntary bonus for exceptional service rather than a necessity.</p>\n<p>There is widespread frustration with the current \"tipping culture.\" Commenters expressed annoyance with the expansion of tipping requests to transactions with minimal or no service, often facilitated by pressure-inducing payment screens. A strong majority believe that tipping should not be forced, mandatory, or expected in every situation.</p>\n<p>While some advocate for getting rid of the tipping system entirely, others proposed specific reforms. One suggestion was to move from a percentage-based system to fixed-dollar amounts. Another unique idea was for the customer to receive a small token of appreciation, like a coupon or a thank-you note, in exchange for a tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
