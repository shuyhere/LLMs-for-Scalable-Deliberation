Most concerns focus on privacy risks, potential misuse, and harm to vulnerable users, while supporters emphasize deterrence of abuse, scams, and misinformation. Many commenters favor nuanced, opt-in, or privacy-preserving verification over blanket, public real-name requirements.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 20s "}}
