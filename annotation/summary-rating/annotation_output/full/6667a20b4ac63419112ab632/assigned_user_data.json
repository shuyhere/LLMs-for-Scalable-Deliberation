These respondents worry about AI systems tracking their preferences and storing personal information without explicit consent. There's also concern about the authenticity of online content, with several people mentioning increased vigilance about distinguishing AI-generated content from human-created work.</p>\n<h6>Mixed Feelings and Adaptation</h6>\n<p>Many respondents demonstrate nuanced views, acknowledging both benefits and drawbacks. While they appreciate AI's utility, they worry about job security, loss of critical thinking skills, and over-dependence on technology. Some actively try to limit their AI use to maintain their own cognitive abilities and creativity.</p>\n<h6>Social and Ethical Implications</h6>\n<p>Several people raise concerns about AI's broader impact on society, including the proliferation of deepfakes, misinformation, and the diminishing quality of human interaction online. There's particular concern among creative professionals and educators about AI potentially replacing human workers or undermining authentic learning and creation.</p>\n<h6>Minimal Impact</h6>\n<p>A smaller group reports that AI hasn't significantly changed their lives yet.
