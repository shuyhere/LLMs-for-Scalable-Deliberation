It is frequently described as a powerful tool for streamlining work, automating routine tasks, and accelerating research. Users highlight its ability to compile information, summarize content, and assist with writing, which collectively saves a considerable amount of time and boosts productivity. For many, this has translated into having more free time and feeling less overwhelmed by their workload. A significant portion also credits AI with enhancing creativity, aiding in artistic endeavors, generating new ideas, and functioning as a tutor for complex subjects.</p>\n<p>However, a distinct and substantial minority of users express serious concerns that counterbalance the positive feedback. The most prominent issue is a deep anxiety over privacy and data security, with several individuals feeling that AI's data collection is an intrusion. Others report a growing sense of distrust, being hyper-vigilant about AI's use in creative fields and wary of consuming AI-generated content. Some note that the information provided by AI is not always reliable, requiring them to fact-check its outputs. A common apprehension is the fear of job displacement due to increasing automation.</p>\n<p>In summary, while AI is widely valued for its role as an efficiency-boosting assistant that saves time and enhances capabilities, its adoption is accompanied by significant unease regarding privacy, data ethics, and societal impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}
