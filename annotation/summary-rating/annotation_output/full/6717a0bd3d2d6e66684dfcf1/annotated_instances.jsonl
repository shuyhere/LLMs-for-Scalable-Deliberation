Several frame the move as politicized or authoritarian, undermining trust in institutions; one notes potential constitutional issues if Congress already appropriated funds.\n- Supportive views: Pro-cut comments emphasize perceived ideological bias/indoctrination in academia (including DEI concerns), argue that government subsidies drive up costs, prefer state/local control, and cite waste or misuse of funds, seeing cuts as a corrective or reform catalyst. A few express trust that there are valid reasons and solutions.\n- Nuanced/conditional views: Some favor targeted reforms or cuts to waste rather than broad reductions, call for alternative solutions to protect core education and research, or say they lack enough details to form a firm opinion.\n- Perceived impacts if cuts proceed: Fewer resources for learning and research, reduced opportunities, department contractions (especially smaller programs), widened inequities, and reputational damage that could deter top talent.\n- Tone: Strong and often emotional language dominates, with anxiety for current and future students common among opponents, and reform-and-efficiency framing common among supporters.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}
