A notable minority oppose it outright, and a smaller group support it conditionally (e.g., as a basic floor, with choice to keep private plans, or limited to citizens).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons for support:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Healthcare is viewed as a human right and a core government responsibility, tied to public welfare, fairness, and national strength.</li>\n<li>Current U.S. care is seen as unaffordable and inaccessible, leading to medical debt, delayed care, and worse outcomes; universal coverage is expected to reduce financial hardship and bankruptcies.</li>\n<li>Emphasis on preventive care and early detection to improve health outcomes and lower long-term costs.</li>\n<li>Economic arguments include improved workforce productivity, global competitiveness, and even national security.</li>\n<li>Skepticism of for-profit insurers\u2019 incentives; belief that a public system can prioritize public good.</li>\n<li>Reference to other developed countries (e.g., Canada, UK) as workable models; some suggest building on Medicare\u2019s infrastructure.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many want dental, vision, and hearing included in \u201cbasic\u201d benefits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conditions and design preferences from supporters:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Maintain choice via a public option alongside private plans; some want an opt-out.</li>\n<li>Ensure timely access and preserve care quality.</li>\n<li>Prioritize affordability and simplicity; integrate with existing coverage to avoid gaps.</li>\n<li>Limit eligibility to citizens for some; others favor charging non-citizens\u2019 governments or individuals.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong focus on preventive services and caps on out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concerns and objections:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Fears about higher taxes, government inefficiency, bureaucratic monitoring, and reduced quality.</li>\n<li>Worries about longer wait times and strained capacity.</li>\n<li>Perception that \u201cnothing is free\u201d and that expanded government programs increase dependency.</li>\n<li>Potential negative impacts on private insurance markets and access to certain medications.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fairness concerns that those who work or pay more could see diminished value or longer waits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lived experiences and anecdotes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many describe being uninsured or underinsured, facing high premiums, deductibles, and denials, choosing between necessities and care, or struggling with Medicaid enrollment delays.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several cite personal or family crises, job loss, and chronic conditions as reasons universal basic coverage is needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common policy ideas mentioned:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Universal basic coverage funded by taxes, with private plans available for supplemental care.</li>\n<li>Expand Medicare/Medicaid or create a simple, nationwide baseline plan focused on preventive and essential services.</li>\n<li>Include dental, vision, and hearing; ensure rapid access; and protect against medical debt.</li>\n<li>Improve efficiency by reallocating existing health dollars and negotiating prices rather than simply spending more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum, most commenters favor government-provided basic health insurance to guarantee equitable, affordable access and reduce financial harm, while opponents emphasize cost, efficiency, and quality risks. Many supporters would accept a model that preserves choice and safeguards timeliness and quality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 19s "}}
