Many view influencers as a modern evolution of media, providing entertainment, information, advice, and product recommendations. They are seen as a valid way to earn a good income while doing something enjoyable. Some compare them to traditional celebrities, but note that influencers can be more relatable. The role is also seen as a powerful one, with some believing influencers are becoming the \"new media houses\" and a future source for news.</p>\n<p>Even those who do not personally follow or relate to influencers often acknowledge their rise as a logical consequence of social media's proliferation and support them as professionals. However, there are also critical perspectives. Some find influencers to be annoying and lacking in genuineness. Concerns were raised about their potential negative impact, such as promoting conformity and discouraging unique creativity. A call for authenticity and responsibility within the profession was also noted.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 35s "}}
