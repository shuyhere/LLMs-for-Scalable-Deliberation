The most common concern was the long-term negative impact on the country's future, with many stating that education is the foundation of society and essential for innovation, economic strength, and global competitiveness. Participants argued that reducing funding would harm students by limiting opportunities and access to higher education, particularly for those from lower-income backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Many also worried about the damage to research and development, suggesting it would lead to a \"brain drain\" as top researchers and academics leave for countries with better funding. This was seen as a threat to progress in critical fields like medicine and technology. A recurring theme was the belief that the cuts were politically motivated. Some commenters described the move as a tactic to create a less-educated, more controllable populace, while others saw it as an authoritarian act to punish institutions perceived as political adversaries.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller percentage of participants supported the cuts, primarily citing ideological reasons. These individuals believe that American academic institutions promote \"Marxist\" or \"radical left-leaning\" politics and are indoctrinating students. They see the funding cuts as a necessary measure to counter this influence and wasteful spending on programs like DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). Some also expressed faith in the decision-maker's reasoning, while others suggested that universities with large endowments or inefficient administrations should not receive taxpayer money.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more nuanced view, acknowledging the need to address wasteful spending but cautioning against deep cuts that could stifle innovation and opportunity. A small number of individuals stated they did not have enough information to form an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 10s "}}
