Supporters believe it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, and improve online behavior. Opponents express strong concerns about privacy, data security, and potential misuse of personal information by companies or governments. Many emphasize the value of anonymous expression for protecting unpopular opinions and personal safety. Some suggest the requirement's acceptability depends on who implements it, with platforms being more acceptable than government mandates. The debate centers on balancing accountability against fundamental freedoms and privacy rights.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
