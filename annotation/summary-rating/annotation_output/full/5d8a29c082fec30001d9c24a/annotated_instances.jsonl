These supporters emphasize empathy, noting they would want safety if in similar circumstances. They highlight that refugees are fleeing life-threatening situations they didn't choose, including war and persecution. Some frame acceptance as a moral obligation, particularly when lives\u2014including those of innocent children\u2014are at stake. Several supporters also view refugee acceptance as a proper use of abundant resources to help those seeking better lives.</p>\n<p>However, support often comes with qualifications. Multiple respondents stress the need for thorough vetting processes, proper integration programs, and education about American society and rules. Some advocate for limits to ensure refugee acceptance doesn't negatively impact citizens' quality of life.</p>\n<p>Opposition centers primarily on economic concerns and perceived unfairness. Critics argue that America cannot afford to accept more refugees while facing its own economic challenges, including national debt and inability to adequately support existing citizens. Some express frustration about resource allocation, believing refugees receive aid that is denied to American citizens, which they view as unfair prioritization.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of respondents cite concerns about long-term demographic and fiscal impacts, worrying that refugee populations may grow over time and strain government resources and social systems.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reveal a complex debate balancing humanitarian impulses against practical concerns about resources, fairness, and national capacity. Even among supporters, there's widespread agreement that any refugee acceptance should include proper screening and integration measures.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}
