The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs function as a tax on consumers.

There is also skepticism that the tariffs will succeed in their goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>In contrast, about 18% of the comments express a positive view of the tariff policy.

The most common reason cited was the belief that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass the increased costs on to them. This was seen as a direct cause of inflation, a burden on household budgets, and a potential trigger for reduced consumer spending and a recession. Several participants also highlighted the negative effects on small businesses that rely on imported goods and resources. Other concerns included damage to international relations, the risk of retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and the belief that the policy is ineffective at bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, about 20% of the comments argued that the tariff policy will have a positive impact. Many in this group framed the policy as a necessary strategy for long-term economic health, even if it causes short-term difficulties. These participants believe the tariffs will help correct unfair trade practices by other countries, make American products more competitive, and ultimately strengthen the domestic economy. Some expressed confidence in the president's business acumen, while others saw it as a way to raise federal revenue and help American workers.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments, roughly 10%, presented a mixed or nuanced perspective. These individuals acknowledged that the policy could have both positive and negative consequences, such as protecting some domestic industries while hurting others. This viewpoint often distinguished between short-term negative effects, like price hikes, and potential long-term benefits, such as better trade deals or a stronger manufacturing base.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 18s "}}
