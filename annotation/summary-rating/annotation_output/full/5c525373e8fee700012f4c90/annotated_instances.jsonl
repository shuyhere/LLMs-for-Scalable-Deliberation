They argue that mandates for vaccination and quarantine are the most effective tools to prevent the spread of disease and protect the wider community, particularly during the uncertain early stages of a pandemic. Some supporters also express that individual choices can have negative consequences for everyone, making government intervention necessary for the greater good.</p>\n<p>Conversely, opposition to enforcement centers on concerns about individual freedom and medical safety.
