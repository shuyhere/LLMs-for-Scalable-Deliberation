They raised concerns about data breaches, identity theft, and companies potentially selling user information to governments or third parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Respondents argued that anonymity enables important discussions on sensitive topics without fear of retaliation. Some noted that requiring real names could suppress legitimate speech, particularly for those with unpopular political views or those seeking support for personal issues.</p>\n<h3>Arguments Supporting Real-Name Registration</h3>\n<p>Those favoring the requirement presented several justifications:</p>\n<p><strong>Accountability and Behavior</strong>: Supporters believe real-name registration would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, and the spread of misinformation.
