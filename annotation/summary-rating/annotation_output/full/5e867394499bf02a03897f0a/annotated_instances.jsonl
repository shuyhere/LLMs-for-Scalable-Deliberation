Many argue it is short-sighted and harmful to students, educators, and society, undermining research, innovation, long-term economic competitiveness, and social mobility. Several fear a \u201cbrain drain,\u201d larger class sizes, program cuts (including arts and extracurriculars), and reduced access to college for low-income students. Health and medical research were frequently cited as especially at risk.\n- A number of commenters attribute the decision to ideological or political motives (e.g., retaliation against perceived left-leaning campuses or a desire to exert control), or to redirect funds elsewhere. Some raise concerns about national standing, civic literacy, and trust in institutions, and a few mention potential legal issues if funds were already appropriated by Congress. Several note personal or community impacts from lost programs and jobs.\n- A smaller group supports some level of cuts, arguing academia has become politicized or inefficient, that schools with large endowments and administrative bloat should rely less on federal money, and that shifting responsibility to states/localities could improve accountability. Some specifically favor reducing DEI-related spending. A few express conditional support only if alternatives or reforms accompany cuts.\n- A minority are unsure or neutral, saying they need more details or suggesting targeted waste reduction rather than broad cuts.\n- Across perspectives, even some who favor restraint in spending caution that indiscriminate cuts risk damaging core educational functions; several call for balanced, targeted reforms that protect essential teaching and research.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 20s "}}
