Some argue that anonymity protects vulnerable groups, such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution, and prevents real-world consequences like job loss or harassment. Many also distrust tech companies' ability to safeguard data or fear government misuse.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments support real-name registration, believing it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and impersonation, and help verify authentic users. Supporters argue that linking online behavior to real identities encourages responsible conduct and enhances safety.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express mixed or conditional views, suggesting that real-name verification might be beneficial only if handled by platforms (not governments), kept private from the public, or made optional to balance safety and privacy. Some propose compromise solutions, such as verified badges for those who choose to disclose their identity. Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between the desire for accountability and the protection of privacy and free expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}
