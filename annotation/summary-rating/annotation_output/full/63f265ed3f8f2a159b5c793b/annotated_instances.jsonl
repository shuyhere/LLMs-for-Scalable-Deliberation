A significant portion of respondents express frustration with the current state of tipping culture in the United States.</p>\n<h6>Main Concerns About Current Tipping Culture</h6>\n<p>Many commenters feel that tipping has become excessive and invasive, particularly with digital payment systems that prompt for tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. Common complaints include being asked to tip for counter service, pickup orders, and minimal-service transactions. Several people describe feeling pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping through awkward point-of-sale interfaces that make it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<h6>The Wage Issue</h6>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Many respondents believe the fundamental problem is that employers use tipping as an excuse to pay workers below a living wage, particularly in the restaurant industry where servers may earn as little as $2.13 per hour. There's widespread agreement that workers should receive fair base wages rather than depending on tips for survival.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Reform</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improving the system is eliminating tipping altogether and requiring employers to pay living wages. Some propose adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices. Others suggest compromises such as making tipping truly optional, limiting tip requests to full-service situations, or implementing flat service charges instead of percentage-based tips.</p>\n<h6>Support for Tipping</h6>\n<p>Despite the criticism, some respondents strongly support tipping, viewing it as a way to reward excellent service and help workers earn more than minimum wage. These supporters often emphasize tipping generously (with some mentioning 20-30% as appropriate) and see it as an incentive for employees to provide better service.</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Many commenters occupy a middle position - they don't object to tipping for genuine service (such as table service or delivery) but resist the expansion of tipping to every transaction. They distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus forced, and many express a desire for tipping to return to being a genuine expression of gratitude rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment suggests that while people want service workers to be fairly compensated, the current tipping system is viewed as problematic, with most preferring either significant reform or complete elimination in favor of fair wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>Based on the comments provided, a clear majority express significant dissatisfaction with the current tipping culture, particularly in the United States. Many believe the system has become overly pervasive, with a large percentage of participants frustrated by being prompted for tips at establishments where they feel no service warranting a tip was provided, such as counter-service or pickup orders. This is frequently described as creating pressure and discomfort for the customer.</p>\n<p>A strong and recurring theme is the belief that employers should be responsible for paying a living wage, thereby eliminating the need for workers to rely on tips for their basic income. Many commenters view the current system as a way for businesses to subsidize labor costs onto the customer. There is a notable sentiment favoring a model similar to those in some European countries, where higher base wages are standard and tipping is less frequent or optional.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the act of tipping itself are mixed. A portion of commenters support tipping for good service in traditional, full-service settings like restaurants but are opposed to its expansion into other transactions. Others maintain that tipping is a positive incentive for excellent service. However, even among those who support the concept, there is widespread agreement that it should be genuinely optional and based solely on the quality of service received, not an expectation to cover low wages.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improvement include replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge, making \"no tip\" options more accessible on point-of-sale systems, and ensuring tips are only solicited after a service has been completed and evaluated. A small minority of comments fully endorse the current system, citing the potential for workers to earn more and the value of rewarding good service, but this perspective is less common. Overall, the collective opinion leans heavily toward systemic change that shifts the responsibility of fair compensation from the consumer to the employer.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
