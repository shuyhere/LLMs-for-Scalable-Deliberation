A significant portion of commenters support accepting refugees, primarily for humanitarian and moral reasons. They express empathy, stating that they would want a safe place to go if in a similar situation. Supporters believe it is right to help those fleeing war and persecution, especially innocent families, and that everyone deserves a chance at a good life. One viewpoint suggests that the U.S. has abundant resources and should use them to help others.</p>\n<p>Conversely, others oppose accepting more refugees, citing economic concerns and the strain on national resources. This perspective argues that the country should prioritize its own citizens' needs, especially given issues like national debt and the perception that Americans are denied resources that are given to newcomers. The potential for increased government expenditure on social needs for a growing refugee population is also a concern.</p>\n<p>A middle ground also exists among those who support accepting refugees but with specific conditions. These commenters emphasize the need for a thorough vetting process to determine refugee status, the implementation of limits to prevent negative impacts on citizens, and providing education to help refugees integrate into American society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
