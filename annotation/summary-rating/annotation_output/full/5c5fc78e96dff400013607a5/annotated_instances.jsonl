Many believe that anonymity is a fundamental right online, allowing for freedom of expression without fear of real-world repercussions, such as job loss due to political beliefs. There is a deep mistrust of how tech companies and governments might use this personal data, with fears of it being sold, used for surveillance, or stolen in data breaches, leading to identity theft and fraud. Several also argued that such a policy could endanger vulnerable individuals, like victims of domestic abuse seeking support online or those in restrictive environments. Some felt the measure would be ineffective, as determined individuals could still use false information, and that it could even worsen cyberbullying by revealing a target's real identity.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, supporters of the requirement believe it would foster a safer and more accountable online environment. The primary argument is that linking real identities to online activity would deter negative behaviors like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Proponents feel this would hold users responsible for their actions. Additionally, some see it as an effective way to combat the proliferation of bots, fake accounts, and impersonation, thereby increasing authenticity and protecting users, especially minors.</p>\n<p>Several comments offered a nuanced or middle-ground perspective. Some suggested a hybrid system where users register with their real identity on the backend for verification, but are still allowed to use a pseudonym publicly. This would allow platforms to take action against nefarious behavior while preserving user privacy. Another alternative proposed was an optional verification system, where users who choose to confirm their identity could receive a badge, allowing others to distinguish between anonymous and verified accounts without making it mandatory for everyone.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
