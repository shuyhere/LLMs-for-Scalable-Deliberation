A majority express support for accepting refugees fleeing war or persecution, emphasizing compassion, moral responsibility, and the historical role of nations as safe havens. Many supporters highlight the importance of rigorous vetting processes to ensure security and integration, while also calling for balanced resource allocation to avoid straining existing systems. A smaller portion oppose or express hesitation, primarily citing economic constraints, domestic priorities, and concerns about the capacity to support both citizens and newcomers. Some comments also advocate for geopolitical fairness, suggesting that refugee acceptance should prioritize underrepresented regions. The discourse underscores a tension between empathy and pragmatism, with widespread acknowledgment of the need for structured, sustainable approaches.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
