They believe it can help prevent <strong>identity theft</strong>, <strong>scams</strong>, and <strong>bot activity</strong>, and make social media platforms more <strong>trustworthy</strong> and <strong>credible</strong>. Some also suggest it could improve <strong>verification</strong> of public figures and businesses, enhancing the overall quality of online interactions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, many oppose the idea, citing <strong>privacy concerns</strong> and the <strong>risk of personal information being misused</strong>. They argue that anonymity is a <strong>fundamental right</strong> and that requiring real names could expose individuals to <strong>harassment</strong>, <strong>stalking</strong>, or even <strong>real-world consequences</strong>, especially for marginalized or vulnerable groups such as victims of domestic abuse. Others are concerned about <strong>data collection and misuse</strong> by social media companies or governments, and the potential for <strong>surveillance</strong> or <strong>censorship</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some respondents express a <strong>neutral or conditional stance</strong>, suggesting that while real-name policies may have benefits, they should be <strong>optional</strong>, or that <strong>verified identities</strong> (e.g., with a badge or mark) could be a better alternative. A few also mention the <strong>practical difficulty</strong> of enforcing such policies without intrusive verification methods like ID documents.</p>\n<p>In general, while a portion of the comments support the idea for its potential to reduce harmful behavior, a significant number oppose it, emphasizing the <strong>importance of anonymity and online privacy</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 16s "}}
