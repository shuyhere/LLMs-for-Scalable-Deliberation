Many emphasized that the U.S. was founded on the principles of refuge and freedom, and that offering sanctuary is consistent with these values. Supporters also highlighted the potential <strong>economic and cultural benefits</strong>, such as increased diversity and workforce contributions.</p>\n<p>A <strong>significant portion of supporters also emphasized the need for proper vetting, integration processes, and safeguards</strong> to ensure national security and social stability. Concerns about <strong>overburdening public resources, economic strain, and competition for services</strong> were frequently mentioned, particularly by those who expressed <strong>opposition or hesitation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some <strong>opposition</strong> was based on the belief that the U.S. should <strong>prioritize its own citizens</strong> and address domestic issues before accepting more refugees. Others raised concerns about <strong>abuse of the system</strong>, <strong>increased crime</strong>, and <strong>cultural tensions</strong>. A smaller group of commenters were <strong>neutral or conflicted</strong>, acknowledging the plight of refugees while expressing uncertainty about the practical implications of increased acceptance.</p>\n<p>A <strong>few commenters opposed the idea outright</strong>, citing <strong>national decline, resource scarcity, and a belief that refugees should seek refuge in neighboring countries</strong>. A handful of comments included <strong>extreme positions</strong>, such as advocating for the <strong>abolition of borders</strong> or suggesting that the U.S. should <strong>not accept refugees due to its domestic challenges</strong>.</p>\n<p>Overall, the tone of the comments reflected a <strong>complex interplay of empathy, national identity, and practical concerns</strong>, with many calling for a <strong>balanced, thoughtful, and compassionate approach</strong> to refugee policy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 25s "}}
