Many express the view that healthcare is a fundamental human right rather than a luxury, and that the current system leaves too many people without adequate coverage due to high costs. Several commenters point to other countries as successful examples of universal healthcare systems. There is a recurring belief that such a system would lead to better health outcomes, greater economic efficiency, and improved national competitiveness. A small minority express conditional support, preferring that government-provided healthcare not be the only option available. Overall, the sentiment emphasizes that access to affordable healthcare is essential for both individual well-being and the broader social good.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
