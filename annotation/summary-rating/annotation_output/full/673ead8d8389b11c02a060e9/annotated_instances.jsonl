A majority express opposition, primarily citing concerns about privacy intrusion, potential misuse of personal data by companies or governments, and the importance of preserving anonymous free speech\u2014particularly for vulnerable groups or those with dissenting opinions. A significant minority support the measure, believing it would increase accountability and reduce negative behaviors like cyberbullying and scams. Some comments acknowledge potential benefits but remain cautious about implementation, suggesting acceptability may depend on whether requirements come from platforms versus governments. The tension centers on balancing public safety benefits against fundamental freedoms and data privacy risks.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 33s "}}
