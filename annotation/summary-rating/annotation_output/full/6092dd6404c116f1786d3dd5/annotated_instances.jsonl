Some express confidence in the business acumen behind these decisions, viewing them as strategic moves that will benefit the country in the long run, even if immediate effects aren't apparent. There's also hope that these policies might help lift American workers out of poverty by prioritizing domestic interests.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those concerned about negative impacts point to several immediate consequences. Many are experiencing price increases directly, viewing tariffs as a driver of inflation that makes everyday living more expensive. Small businesses are seen as particularly vulnerable to these policies. There's worry about damaged international relationships, especially with China, and concern that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading partners, potentially isolating the U.S. economically. Critics also question whether the tariffs are creating meaningful employment opportunities for American workers while noting the burden on consumers.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme among critics is that the policy may disproportionately benefit wealthy individuals while placing the economic burden on average citizens and small businesses. Meanwhile, supporters tend to focus on long-term economic sovereignty and the need to rebalance trade relationships that they view as historically unfavorable to the United States.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a fundamental disagreement about whether short-term economic discomfort is worth potential long-term gains, and whether the current approach will ultimately strengthen or weaken America's position in the global economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 7s "}}
