About 56\u201357% support enforcing both vaccination and quarantine; roughly 14\u201315% support enforcing quarantine but oppose mandatory vaccination. Around 10% oppose vaccine mandates (unclear on quarantine), and about 19% oppose any enforcement. In total, about 71% support at least some enforcement.</p>\n<p>Reasons for supporting enforcement\n- Protecting public health and the \u201cgreater good,\u201d including herd immunity and shielding vulnerable groups (elderly, immunocompromised, children).\n- Lessons from COVID: faster control of spread, fewer deaths, and quicker return to normal when measures are widely adopted.\n- Collective action requires government coordination when individual choices risk others\u2019 health.\n- Some endorse penalties or restricted access for noncompliance.\n- Many support enforcement only during truly severe outbreaks and when vaccines are proven safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Reasons for opposing enforcement\n- Bodily autonomy and personal freedom; belief that individuals should choose what enters their bodies.\n- Distrust in government competence, transparency, or motives; concerns about politicization.\n- Safety worries about rapidly developed vaccines and lack of long\u2011term data; perceived side effects.\n- Constitutional/rights-based objections and fear of government overreach or abuse.</p>\n<p>Nuanced and conditional views\n- Support quarantine but not vaccination mandates; encourage vaccines, allow private rules (e.g., entry requirements), and rely on personal responsibility.\n- Mandates should be time-limited, evidence-based, and lifted as conditions improve.\n- Vaccines should be free, FDA-approved, transparent in ingredients and data, and accompanied by strong public education.\n- Exemptions or case-by-case considerations for medical reasons; safeguards against inequities.</p>\n<p>Common implementation guardrails suggested\n- Clear thresholds for \u201csevere epidemic\u201d status.\n- Proof of vaccine effectiveness and safety, transparent communication, and ongoing monitoring.\n- Sunset clauses and periodic review.\n- Public funding to avoid cost barriers.\n- Respect for civil liberties balanced with protection of public health.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 54s "}}
