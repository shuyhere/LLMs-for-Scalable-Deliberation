A majority express frustration with the expectation of tipping across numerous service contexts, particularly when minimal or no service is provided. Many emphasize that employers should pay living wages instead of relying on customer tips to subsidize worker incomes. There is notable criticism of point-of-sale systems that pressure customers with pre-selected tip options.</p>\n<p>Opinions are divided on whether tipping should be entirely abolished or restructured. Some support tipping as a voluntary reward for exceptional service, while others prefer standardized service charges or fixed amounts instead of percentages. A small percentage view tipping positively as a gesture of appreciation but believe it should remain optional. Concerns are also raised about the financial burden on consumers and the inconsistency in tipping practices.</p>\n<p>Several comments suggest learning from models in other countries where tipping is less prevalent. There is a clear desire for greater transparency, reduced pressure on customers, and fair compensation for workers independent of tips.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
