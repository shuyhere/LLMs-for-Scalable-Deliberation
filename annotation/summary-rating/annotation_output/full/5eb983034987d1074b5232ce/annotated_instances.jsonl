A common sentiment is that tipping culture has become excessive and intrusive, with many establishments now requesting tips for minimal or no service through digital checkout systems.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns About Current System</h6>\n<p>Respondents frequently mention feeling pressured or obligated to tip, even in situations where traditionally no tip was expected (such as picking up takeout orders or coffee). Many describe the proliferation of digital tipping screens at checkout as uncomfortable and manipulative. There's widespread frustration about tipping expanding beyond traditional service roles into nearly every transaction.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments highlight the fundamental issue of workers being underpaid and relying on tips for survival. Respondents note that tipped workers often earn well below minimum wage (with servers earning as little as $2.13 per hour mentioned), making tips essential rather than optional.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most popular suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure workers receive a living wage instead. Many respondents would prefer businesses to pay fair wages directly rather than shifting this responsibility to customers. Some suggest implementing a mandatory service charge (typically around 10%) similar to systems in Europe and Japan.</p>\n<p>Other proposed improvements include:\n- Making tipping truly optional and based on service quality\n- Removing or simplifying digital tipping prompts\n- Restricting tipping to traditional full-service situations only\n- Ensuring all workers earn at least minimum wage before tips</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Tipping</h6>\n<p>While most comments are critical, a minority of respondents support tipping when it rewards good service or helps workers earn above minimum wage. These supporters often mention being generous tippers themselves and view tips as incentives for quality service. However, even among supporters, there's acknowledgment that the current system places unfair burden on both workers and customers.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a strong desire for systemic change that would make tipping less obligatory and ensure workers receive fair compensation without relying on customer generosity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
