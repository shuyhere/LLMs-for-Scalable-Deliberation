Many feel this is an unfair burden and a way for companies to subsidize their payroll.</p>\n<p>Another major point of contention is the expansion of tipping requests to scenarios where minimal or no service is provided, such as for pickup orders, coffee shops, and counter service. The proliferation of tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip on every transaction is a frequently cited source of pressure and discomfort.</p>\n<p>The most commonly proposed solution is to eliminate the current tipping system entirely and require businesses to pay all employees a fair, livable wage. Some suggest this could be achieved by raising menu prices to incorporate labor costs. Another popular alternative is to adopt a model used in other countries, such as implementing a mandatory, fixed-percentage service charge.</p>\n<p>While the overall sentiment is negative, there is some conditional support for tipping. A number of participants believe tipping is appropriate and should be reserved for rewarding exceptional, \"above and beyond\" service, particularly in traditional sit-down restaurant settings. However, there is strong agreement that it should be a voluntary act of gratitude rather than a forced or expected obligation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
