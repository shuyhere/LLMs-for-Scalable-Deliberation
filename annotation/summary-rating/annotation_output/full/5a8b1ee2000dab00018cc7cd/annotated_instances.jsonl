They express empathy, stating that offering safety to those fleeing life-threatening situations is the \"right thing to do.\" Several point to America's history as a nation built by people escaping harsh conditions and argue that the U.S. has the resources and capability to help. Some also believe the U.S. has a responsibility to act, especially if its foreign policy contributed to the conflicts, and that accepting refugees can bring benefits like cultural diversity.</p>\n<p>Conversely, another group opposes accepting more refugees, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens and internal problems first. These commenters cite domestic issues such as national debt, struggling American families, and a strain on social systems and resources. Concerns were also raised that the current immigration system is overwhelmed and that resources are being diverted from citizens in need.</p>\n<p>A large number of participants hold a conditional or nuanced position. While they support the principle of accepting refugees, they attach important stipulations. The most frequently mentioned condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to screen for criminal backgrounds and ensure national security. Other common conditions include setting limits on the number of refugees, ensuring that their arrival does not negatively impact the economy or strain resources for current citizens, and distinguishing between genuine refugees and economic migrants. Some also suggested the need for programs to help refugees integrate into American society.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a deep conflict between the compassionate ideal of providing a safe haven and pragmatic concerns about the nation's capacity and the well-being of its current population.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 12s "}}
