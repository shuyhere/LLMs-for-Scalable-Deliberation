Many argue that anonymity is a fundamental right online, essential for protecting individuals from potential risks such as doxxing, identity theft, harassment, or real-world consequences stemming from their expressed opinions. Some specifically mention the importance of anonymity for vulnerable groups, such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution, allowing them to seek resources or express views without fear. Concerns are also raised about the intrusive nature of enforcement, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and the risk of sensitive information being exposed in data breaches.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial portion of commentators support the idea, believing it would foster greater accountability and reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Proponents argue that linking online actions to a real identity would encourage more responsible behavior, help verify authentic users, reduce bots and impersonation, and aid in investigations of malicious activity. Some suggest that while they support the concept for safety reasons, they prefer it to be managed by platforms rather than governments or to have the real name verified but not publicly displayed.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express mixed or conditional views, acknowledging both the potential benefits for safety and the significant risks to privacy. Some propose compromise solutions, such as optional real-name use, verification systems that grant a \"verified\" status without exposing the name publicly, or requiring real names only for platform backend verification while allowing pseudonymous public profiles.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation highlights a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the paramount importance placed on privacy, free expression, and protection from potential harms that could arise from mandatory identity disclosure. The need for a balanced approach that addresses safety without compromising fundamental rights is a recurring theme.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}
