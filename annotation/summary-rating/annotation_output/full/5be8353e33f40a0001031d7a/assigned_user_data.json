Many respondents believe the fundamental problem is that employers use tipping as an excuse to pay workers below a living wage, particularly in the restaurant industry where servers may earn as little as $2.13 per hour. There's widespread agreement that workers should receive fair base wages rather than depending on tips for survival.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Reform</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improving the system is eliminating tipping altogether and requiring employers to pay living wages. Some propose adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices. Others suggest compromises such as making tipping truly optional, limiting tip requests to full-service situations, or implementing flat service charges instead of percentage-based tips.</p>\n<h6>Support for Tipping</h6>\n<p>Despite the criticism, some respondents strongly support tipping, viewing it as a way to reward excellent service and help workers earn more than minimum wage. These supporters often emphasize tipping generously (with some mentioning 20-30% as appropriate) and see it as an incentive for employees to provide better service.</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Many commenters occupy a middle position - they don't object to tipping for genuine service (such as table service or delivery) but resist the expansion of tipping to every transaction. They distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus forced, and many express a desire for tipping to return to being a genuine expression of gratitude rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment suggests that while people want service workers to be fairly compensated, the current tipping system is viewed as problematic, with most preferring either significant reform or complete elimination in favor of fair wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "type": "comparison", "model": "comparison", "num_samples_group": 90, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": "qwen3-32b", "model_b": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "summary_a_id": "af5b0b6c8a7fd6bf", "summary_b_id": "ab010629648a3485", "summary_a_text": "The comments provided reflect a wide range of perspectives on the tipping system, with many expressing frustration over its current form and calling for reform.
