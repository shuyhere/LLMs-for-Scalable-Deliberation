The primary arguments in favor were rooted in humanitarianism, empathy, and morality, with many stating that offering refuge is a compassionate and fundamental human responsibility. Several participants felt it was the \"right thing to do,\" putting themselves in the refugees' shoes or highlighting that everyone deserves to live in safety. Others pointed to American values and history, noting the nation was founded by those fleeing persecution and should serve as a safe haven. A few argued that the U.S. has a particular obligation to help, either due to its role in foreign conflicts or its abundance of resources.</p>\n<p>However, this support was frequently qualified. A substantial number of participants, including many who were generally in favor, insisted on the need for rigorous and thorough vetting processes to ensure national security and screen out criminals. Other common conditions included placing limits on the number of refugees to avoid overwhelming national systems and ensuring that accepting refugees does not negatively impact the economy or the quality of life for current citizens.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of commenters opposed accepting more refugees. The most common reason was the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens and internal problems first. These participants cited issues like national debt, strain on social systems, and the perception that American citizens are struggling and not receiving adequate support. Some expressed concern that an influx of refugees would deplete resources and create competition with citizens. A few also suggested that refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a deep tension between the moral and humanitarian impulse to help those in dire situations and the practical concerns regarding national security, economic stability, and the well-being of the nation's current population.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 37s "}}
