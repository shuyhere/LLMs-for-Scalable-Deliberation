About 30% oppose mandates.\n- Reasons for support: protecting public health and the greater good, preventing disease spread, lessons from the recent pandemic, and the view that early, decisive measures are necessary when uncertainty is high.\n- Conditional views emphasize that enforcement should be temporary or contingent on strong evidence of vaccine safety and effectiveness, with measures relaxed as knowledge grows.\n- Reasons for opposition: respect for individual beliefs and autonomy, skepticism that mandates change behavior, and concerns about vaccine safety and the adequacy of testing, especially early in the COVID-19 response.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
