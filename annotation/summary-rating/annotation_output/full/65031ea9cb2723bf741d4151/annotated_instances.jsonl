The most prevalent argument was that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and should be accessible to all regardless of income, class, or employment status. Many felt it was the government's moral duty to care for its citizens' well-being.</p>\n<p>Several participants pointed to the current system's failures, citing prohibitive costs, lack of access, and the fear of medical debt as significant problems. They argued that a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes through preventative care and early diagnosis.

Some also framed the issue as an economic necessity, arguing a healthier population is a more productive one.</p>\n<p>While support was widespread, some commenters attached specific conditions. A recurring theme was the importance of choice, with several advocating for a public option that coexists with private insurance rather than a single-payer system.
