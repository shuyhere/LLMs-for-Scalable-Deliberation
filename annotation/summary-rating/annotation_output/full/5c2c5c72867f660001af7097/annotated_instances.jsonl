About 57% opposed requiring real-name registration, roughly 33% supported it, and around 10% offered conditional or mixed views.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for opposing\n- Privacy and safety: Strong concerns about doxxing, stalking, harassment, domestic abuse situations, and exposure in hostile or restrictive environments.\n- Free expression and reputational risk: Fear of job loss, social or political backlash, and a chilling effect on speech.\n- Data security and trust: Worries about hacks, data breaches, government access, and platforms selling or misusing personal data.\n- Identity theft and fraud: Requiring more PII was seen as increasing risk rather than reducing it.\n- Limited effectiveness: Belief that determined bad actors can fake identities, use stolen IDs, or create multiple accounts; enforcement seen as impractical.\n- Participation costs: Some would reduce or stop using social media if forced to reveal their real identity.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for supporting\n- Accountability and civility: Expectation that tying accounts to real identities would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, hate, and misinformation.\n- Safety and integrity: Hoped-for reductions in scams, bots, catfishing, and impersonation; easier investigations; protection of minors; more credibility and authenticity.\n- Emerging risks: Concern that advances (e.g., AI misuse) heighten the need for verification.</p>\n<p>Conditional/compromise ideas\n- Platform-led, not government-mandated: Preference for platform verification over state requirements.\n- Backend verification with public pseudonyms: KYC-like checks held privately by platforms, with real names hidden unless there\u2019s abuse or legal need.\n- Optional verification: Voluntary \u201cverified\u201d badges for individuals, public figures, or businesses; encourage rather than coerce.\n- Strong safeguards: Data minimization, strict access controls, transparency, and due process for unmasking.</p>\n<p>Bottom line\n- Many value accountability benefits, but a larger share prioritize privacy, safety, and feasibility concerns. There is notable openness to privacy-preserving verification (optional or backend-only) rather than blanket, public real-name mandates.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 36s "}}
