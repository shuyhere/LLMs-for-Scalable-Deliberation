Many commenters argue that the system places undue pressure on customers and that tipping is frequently expected even in situations where service is minimal or nonexistent. Concerns are also raised about the design of point-of-sale systems, which often default to tipping prompts, making it difficult or uncomfortable for customers to decline.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that service workers should be paid a fair, livable wage, rather than relying on tips to make ends meet. Many suggest that the tipping system should be replaced or reformed to ensure that workers are not left in vulnerable positions due to inconsistent customer generosity. Some propose alternatives, such as a mandatory service charge or integrating service costs into the base price of goods and services.</p>\n<p>While some commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, they emphasize that it should be voluntary and based on the quality of the service received. Others suggest that tipping should be limited to specific industries, such as full-service restaurants, and not extended to fast food or other low-contact services.</p>\n<p>A few commenters advocate for the complete abolition of the tipping system, arguing that it is an outdated and unnecessary practice that disproportionately affects both consumers and workers. In contrast, a smaller group views tipping as a positive tradition that incentivizes good service and should be maintained as long as it remains optional and not forced upon customers.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback suggests a strong desire for a more equitable and transparent system that ensures fair compensation for workers while reducing pressure and ambiguity for consumers. Many believe that the responsibility for fair wages should lie with employers rather than customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 6s "}}
