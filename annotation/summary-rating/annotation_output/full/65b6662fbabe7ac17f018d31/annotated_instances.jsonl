Many of these supportive views are conditional, calling for thorough vetting, clear and strict criteria for refugee status, reasonable limits/caps to protect quality of life for residents, and education/integration programs to help newcomers adapt.\n- Opponents argue that the country lacks the financial capacity, citing debt, strain on social systems, and the need to prioritize citizens first. They express concerns about long-term increases in costs and resource competition, and some conflate refugee policy with illegal immigration, fueling perceptions of unfairness in how aid is allocated.\n- Areas of potential common ground include: prioritizing those fleeing imminent danger; stronger vetting and eligibility standards; setting intake limits aligned with capacity; investing in integration and civic education; and ensuring transparency about costs, funding sources, and safeguards to prevent negative impacts on existing communities.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}
