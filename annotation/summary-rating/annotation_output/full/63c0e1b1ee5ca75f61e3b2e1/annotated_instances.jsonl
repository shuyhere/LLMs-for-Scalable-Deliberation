The most common concern, expressed by over half of the commentators, is that the costs of tariffs will be passed directly to consumers, leading to higher prices for everyday goods, increased inflation, and a greater financial burden on American households, particularly the middle class and the poor.</p>\n<p>Several participants argued that the policy would harm international relations, leading to retaliatory tariffs from other nations, damaging free trade, and isolating the U.S. in the global market. There were also specific concerns about the negative impact on small businesses, which may struggle with increased costs and disruptions to international trade. Some believe the policy is unlikely to achieve its goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., suggesting companies will either raise prices or find ways around the tariffs rather than relocate their operations.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of participants viewed the tariff policy in a positive light. The primary argument from this perspective is that the policy will have long-term benefits, even if it causes short-term difficulties. Supporters believe the tariffs will correct unfair trade practices, make U.S. goods more competitive, and ultimately strengthen the domestic economy. Some expressed confidence in the administration's business strategy, arguing that the policy will help stabilize the economy and reduce national debt.</p>\n<p>A few participants offered a mixed view, acknowledging that while the policy might protect certain domestic industries, it also creates economic uncertainty and raises costs for consumers. This group often framed the issue as one of short-term pain for potential long-term gain.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
