Multiple respondents express anxiety about AI systems collecting and storing personal information without explicit consent. This has led some to develop heightened vigilance about AI-generated content and a general mistrust of digital interactions. The fear of AI accessing personal data represents a major source of discomfort for these users.</p>\n<h6>Mixed or Limited Impact</h6>\n<p>Some respondents report minimal life changes from AI, viewing it merely as an optional tool rather than a transformative technology.
