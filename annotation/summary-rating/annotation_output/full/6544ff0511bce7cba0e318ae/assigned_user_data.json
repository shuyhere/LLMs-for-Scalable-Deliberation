A majority of comments express frustration with \"tipping fatigue,\" feeling pressured or bullied into tipping, especially through tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip on nearly every transaction.

Participants overwhelmingly believe that tipping has become a way for businesses to subsidize employee pay, shifting the financial responsibility from the employer to the consumer.</p>\n<p>The most popular proposed solution is to eliminate the reliance on tipping by requiring employers to pay their employees a fair, livable wage. In this model, tipping would return to its original purpose: a voluntary and optional reward for exceptional service, rather than a necessary component of a worker's income.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions for improvement include:\n*   Replacing discretionary tipping with a mandatory, fixed service charge, similar to systems in Europe or Japan.\n*   Modifying payment systems to make the \"no tip\" option more accessible and less uncomfortable to select.\n*   Restricting tipping requests to full-service environments like sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>While the system itself is heavily criticized, many individuals still feel compelled to tip, often generously.
