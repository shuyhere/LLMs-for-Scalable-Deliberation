Supporters argue that these measures are essential for protecting public health, ensuring herd immunity, and preventing the spread of disease. Many reference the recent pandemic as a justification, noting that such actions helped reduce the impact of the outbreak and saved lives. Some emphasize the importance of scientific evidence and public health guidance, stating that the government has a responsibility to act in the best interest of the population.

Critics argue that the government should not have the power to dictate what people put into their bodies and that mandates can be abused or misapplied. Some express distrust in government decision-making, particularly in how they handled the pandemic, and question the safety and long-term effects of vaccines.
