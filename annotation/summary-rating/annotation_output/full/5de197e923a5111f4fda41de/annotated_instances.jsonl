Many describe feeling guilted or \u201cbullied\u201d into tipping.\n- Compensation model: Strong support for employers paying a livable/base wage (ending sub-minimum wage) so workers don\u2019t rely on tips. Several point to European models or want service included in prices or through a standard service charge.\n- Role of tipping: Many prefer tipping to be optional and merit-based, used to reward good service rather than expected by default or requested before service is delivered. A smaller group favors generous tipping regardless, often due to empathy for workers\u2019 low pay.\n- System changes suggested:\n  - Replace or reduce tipping with: higher wages, integrated service fees, or a compulsory modest service charge with tipping remaining optional.\n  - Improve point-of-sale design: easy-to-find \u201cno tip\u201d option, prompt only when a clear service is provided, and only after service is rendered; allow service ratings.\n  - Standardize tipping approaches: some propose fixed dollar tips instead of percentages, or consistent guidelines by purchase level; a few suggest incentives like thank-you notes or coupons; one suggests tips not be taxed.\n- Pain points: Tipping for pickup/zero service, expanding expectations to more venues, affordability concerns for consumers, and pressure to tip even for poor service.</p>\n<p>Overall, commenters lean toward reducing or eliminating tipping pressure and shifting responsibility for fair pay to employers, while keeping gratuities as a voluntary reward for good service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 44s "}}
