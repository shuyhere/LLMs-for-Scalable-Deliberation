While certain industries, like steel and aluminum, may benefit from temporary protection, others\u2014such as agriculture and manufacturing\u2014face retaliatory tariffs that reduce competitiveness abroad. In the long run, these trade tensions risk slowing economic growth and straining relationships with key global partners.\r\n"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}

About 60% view the tariff policy as harmful, citing higher consumer prices and inflation, strain on small businesses, limited job creation, deteriorating relations with China, and partners diverting trade away from the U.S. About 40% see potential benefits, arguing tariffs can boost federal revenue, rebalance trade, and deliver long-term gains under business-focused leadership; some report no noticeable price increases and expect positive budget effects if the policy endures.
