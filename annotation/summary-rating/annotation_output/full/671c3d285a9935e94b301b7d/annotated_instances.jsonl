Many feel tipping has become over-expected, coercive, and intrusive\u2014especially due to tablet prompts, pre-service requests, and tipping for minimal/zero service (pickup, counter service, coffee).\n- Employer responsibility: Broad agreement that businesses\u2014not customers\u2014should ensure livable, predictable wages. Many want to abolish the subminimum wage and raise base pay (often citing at least $15/hour) so tips become optional bonuses rather than necessities.\n- Preferred reforms:\n  - Replace tipping with service-included pricing or a fixed service charge (often around 10%), or fold compensation into menu prices\u2014citing European/Japanese models.\n  - Keep tipping strictly optional and tied to quality of service, given only after service is rendered.\n  - Limit tipping expectations to full-service restaurants; discourage or remove prompts for counter service, pickup, drive-thru, or low-touch transactions.\n  - Improve point-of-sale design: clear \u201cno tip\u201d option, no default pressure, and no pre-service prompts.\n  - Ensure minimum standards: some suggest minimum wages for all tipped workers, no taxes on tips, or employer matching a portion of tips.\n  - A few propose standardizing tipping (e.g., fixed-dollar tips rather than percentages) or making tips mandatory only if wages remain low.\n- Rationale: Current norms shift labor costs to consumers, create social pressure and guilt, strain budgets, and leave workers with uncertain incomes. Tipping should reward exceptional service, not subsidize base pay.\n- Minority perspectives: A smaller share defends tipping as a useful incentive and reports always tipping generously; a few support mandatory tips or embedding them in the bill to guarantee worker income.\n- Common ground: Regardless of stance on tipping\u2019s future, there is strong agreement that workers deserve fair, livable, and predictable compensation, and that any tipping that remains should be voluntary and merit-based.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 18s "}}
