Many in this group support voluntary vaccination, sometimes paired with access rules or other consequences for those who decline.</li>\n<li>Roughly 29% oppose government enforcement (especially vaccine mandates). Their reasons include bodily autonomy and consent, constitutional/civil liberty concerns, distrust of government/public health agencies, perceived poor handling of COVID-19, and worries about vaccine safety or insufficient long-term data.
