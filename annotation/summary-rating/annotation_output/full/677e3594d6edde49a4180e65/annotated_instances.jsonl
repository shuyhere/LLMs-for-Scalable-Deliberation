A significant portion of the comments express support for accepting refugees, often grounded in moral or humanitarian reasoning, such as the belief that everyone deserves safety, kindness, and a chance at a better life. Many emphasize the importance of vetting processes to ensure security and integration into society.</p>\n<p>However, a smaller but vocal portion of the comments oppose accepting more refugees, citing concerns about the financial burden on the country, the impact on existing social systems, and the prioritization of resources for current citizens. Some express frustration with how resources are distributed, particularly in comparison to undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>A common theme among the supportive comments is the recognition of refugees as individuals seeking safety and a better future, while the opposing views often focus on systemic and economic challenges. Several commenters suggest that while accepting refugees is a moral duty, it should be done responsibly with clear limits and thorough vetting to protect both national interests and the well-being of citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 25s "}}
