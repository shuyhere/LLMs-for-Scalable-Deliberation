A significant portion of respondents support such measures, emphasizing public health, collective safety, and the role of science in preventing disease spread. Many in this group highlight the importance of herd immunity, protecting vulnerable populations, and the government\u2019s responsibility to act for the greater good, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage express opposition, primarily citing concerns over personal freedom, bodily autonomy, and distrust in government or pharmaceutical institutions. Some critics question the safety and long-term testing of vaccines, particularly those developed rapidly, and argue that enforcement could infringe on individual rights or reflect governmental overreach. A smaller subset supports quarantine measures but opposes mandatory vaccination, advocating for optional participation instead.</p>\n<p>Several comments also present conditional support, suggesting that enforcement should depend on factors like the severity of the epidemic, vaccine effectiveness, equitable access, and transparent public communication. Trust in government and scientific integrity emerges as a recurring theme influencing positions on both sides.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
