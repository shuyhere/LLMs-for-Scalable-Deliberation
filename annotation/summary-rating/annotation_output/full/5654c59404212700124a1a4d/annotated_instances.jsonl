There is a widespread belief that businesses pass these costs directly to consumers, reducing purchasing power and potentially slowing economic growth. Some comments also highlight strained international relations, arguing that tariffs alienate trading partners, create uncertainty, and could lead to retaliatory measures. Others express skepticism about the policy's effectiveness in reshoring jobs or boosting domestic industry, noting that supply chains and manufacturing capabilities have largely moved overseas and cannot be easily rebuilt.</p>\n<p>Positive viewpoints, though less common, emphasize long-term benefits, such as increased federal revenue and potential economic stabilization. Supporters argue that tariffs correct historical trade imbalances, protect domestic industries, and may encourage investment in U.S. manufacturing over time. Some believe the policy could ultimately raise wages and reduce poverty, though they acknowledge short-term challenges.</p>\n<p>A small number of comments suggest mixed or uncertain outcomes, recognizing potential benefits for specific industries but overall concerns about consumer costs and economic volatility. In summary, while some see strategic value in the tariffs, most anticipate negative consequences for consumers, businesses, and broader economic stability.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
