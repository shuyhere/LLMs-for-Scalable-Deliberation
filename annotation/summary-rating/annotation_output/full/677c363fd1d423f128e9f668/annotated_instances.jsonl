A majority of comments express a desire to eliminate or fundamentally restructure the system, citing that it feels overbearing, as tipping prompts now appear in many non-traditional settings. There is a strong consensus that employers should pay a living wage, shifting the financial burden away from customers and ensuring workers do not have to rely on tips for their income.</p>\n<p>Opinions are divided on what an improved system should look like. Some suggest tipping should remain as a voluntary gesture for good service, while others propose fixed amounts instead of percentages. A minority of comments support the current system when it is not mandatory and reflects service quality, though even these express that it should not feel pressured. A small portion of comments suggest positive reinforcement, such as thank you notes or coupons, as a way to make tipping feel more reciprocal and valued.</p>\n<p>In summary, the prevailing view is that the responsibility for fair pay should lie with employers, not customers, and that any form of tipping should be a genuine choice rather than an expectation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 1s "}}
