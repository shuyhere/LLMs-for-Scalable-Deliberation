Supporters see it as a way for people to earn a good income doing something they enjoy with flexibility. They value influencers for providing entertainment, information, advice, and product recommendations, with some seeing them as a new, more accessible form of media or a modern equivalent to traditional celebrities. The content is often seen as relatable and beneficial, opening up new avenues for creators and audiences alike.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there are strong criticisms of the profession. A recurring concern is the lack of authenticity, with some describing influencers as \"fake,\" \"annoying,\" and not genuine. Others feel the market is oversaturated, leading to a lack of creativity and originality as creators simply follow trends. Deeper societal concerns were also raised, with some finding the culture of self-branding \"depressing\" or isolating, potentially giving younger audiences unrealistic ideas about success.</p>\n<p>Many participants expressed a more balanced perspective, acknowledging influencing as a natural evolution of media and commerce in the digital age. While they may not personally follow influencers, they understand and accept it as a valid profession. This acceptance, however, often comes with a call for greater responsibility and accountability. Commenters emphasized that because influencers have a significant impact on their audience, they should be mindful of their content and behave ethically, noting that the profession is not as regulated as others.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
