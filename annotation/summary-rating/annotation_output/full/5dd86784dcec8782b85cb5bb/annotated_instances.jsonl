These individuals often appeal to empathy, stating that they would want a safe place to go if they were in a similar situation. The core reasons for support include the moral obligation to help innocent people, especially children and families, fleeing life-threatening situations like war and persecution. Some also believe that a nation with resources should use them to help those seeking a better and safer life.</p>\n<p>However, this support is often conditional. Several commenters emphasize the need for a thorough vetting process to ensure applicants genuinely qualify for refugee status. There are also calls for limits on the number of refugees accepted and for programs to help them integrate into American society.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there is opposition to accepting more refugees, primarily due to economic concerns and the perceived strain on national resources. These participants argue that the government should prioritize its own citizens, who may be struggling, before taking on the expense of supporting newcomers. This viewpoint highlights concerns about government debt, the burden on social systems, and a belief that resources are unfairly allocated to refugees over American citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}
