The most common concern is the negative long-term impact on the country's future, with commenters stating that education is the foundation of society and that reducing its funding weakens national competitiveness and sets up future failure.</p>\n<p>Specific concerns raised include:\n*   <strong>Harm to Individuals:</strong> The cuts are seen as unfair to students and adults seeking to further their education, particularly those who cannot afford college without financial support.\n*   <strong>Loss of Innovation:</strong> Participants worry that reduced funding will limit resources for research, leading to a \"brain drain\" of academic talent to other countries and hindering progress in critical fields like medical research.\n*   <strong>Decline in Quality:</strong> There is a belief that limiting resources will inevitably lead to a decline in the quality of education for all.</p>\n<p>While the majority of comments were negative, a few offered more nuanced viewpoints. One perspective suggested there could be some justification for funding reductions due to a perceived political bias in academic institutions, though this was coupled with the concern that cuts could also stifle independent thinking. Another comment expressed cautious trust that there might be a reason for the policy, while still warning of negative consequences if an alternative solution is not provided. Additionally, some felt they did not have enough information to form an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 1s "}}

Ultimately, you want to fund research that generates \"good stuff\".  So I think it is important that universities understand that grants from NIH or DOD or whoever aren't entitlements - you have to actually work for them.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think that Trump's use of these grants as a club to compel the universities to bend a knee to him is completely inappropriate.  Ditto for using these grants to compel the universities to abandon DEI initiatives.  That kind of thing should be backed by congressional action, not just the whim of the president.  So if Congress passed some laws saying you can't do DEI, then withholding grants to universities that didn't comply would be fine.  (Not necessarily fine as a moral issue, but fine as a legal issue.)"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 49s "}}
