Many highlight that consumers are already experiencing price increases on everyday goods, with particular worry about the impact on middle-class families and those already struggling financially. Several commenters emphasize that companies typically pass tariff costs directly to consumers rather than absorbing them, effectively making tariffs a \"tax on the people.\"</p>\n<p>Small business owners report being particularly affected, with some noting they can no longer afford to import necessary materials and products for their operations. Others in logistics and shipping industries describe seeing decreased package volumes and reduced work opportunities as customers become more hesitant to make purchases.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Economic Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>While many see immediate negative effects, some respondents believe the tariffs could yield positive results over time. These optimistic voices argue that tariffs will help level the playing field with other nations, bring additional revenue to the U.S. treasury, and potentially encourage domestic manufacturing. Several supporters view the policy as necessary for reducing the trade deficit and strengthening America's economic position globally.</p>\n<p>However, skeptics counter that rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity and supply chains will take years, during which consumers will suffer from higher prices. Some doubt whether companies will actually invest in reshoring operations, suggesting they may simply wait out the policy changes.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Many comments express concern about the tariffs' impact on America's global standing and trade relationships. Respondents worry about retaliatory measures from other countries, the erosion of free trade principles, and damage to America's reputation as a reliable trading partner. Some specifically mention concerns about relationships with allies like Canada, Australia, and Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Implementation Criticisms</strong></p>\n<p>Several respondents criticize the implementation of the tariff policy as poorly conceived, describing it as \"capricious,\" \"nonsensical,\" or used as a weapon rather than a strategic economic tool. Critics argue that blanket universal tariffs lack the targeted precision needed for effective trade policy and create unnecessary market uncertainty.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Sentiment</strong></p>\n<p>The predominant view expressed is that the tariff policy will have a negative impact on both the U.S. economy and society. Concerns about inflation, reduced consumer purchasing power, and economic hardship outweigh optimism about potential long-term benefits. Those supporting the policy tend to focus on fairness in international trade and the possibility of eventual economic strengthening, though they often acknowledge short-term challenges.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a general anxiety about economic uncertainty, with many Americans feeling the immediate pressure of higher prices while remaining skeptical that promised benefits will materialize in a meaningful way for average citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
