A significant portion of respondents express frustration, citing concerns about <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>, <strong>environmental waste</strong> due to frequent disposal, and <strong>financial strain</strong> on consumers who feel pressured to upgrade. Many perceive yearly updates as <strong>unnecessary or incremental</strong>, with minimal noticeable improvements between generations, and criticize manufacturers for prioritizing profit over product longevity and sustainability.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some acknowledge benefits such as <strong>enhanced security</strong>, <strong>technological innovation</strong>, and improved performance, appreciating how rapid advancements keep technology competitive and functional. However, even supporters often caution against excessive frequency, suggesting that a <strong>slower, more deliberate cycle</strong>\u2014such as biennial major releases\u2014could balance innovation with consumer and environmental needs.</p>\n<p>Common themes include skepticism toward corporate motives, calls for greater emphasis on <strong>software support and repairability</strong> of existing devices, and dissatisfaction with the perceived decline in product durability compared to past electronics. A minority emphasize the utility of smartphones in modern life but still question the necessity of relentless hardware updates. Overall, participants desire a more sustainable, consumer-friendly approach that reduces waste and financial pressure while maintaining meaningful technological progress.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}
