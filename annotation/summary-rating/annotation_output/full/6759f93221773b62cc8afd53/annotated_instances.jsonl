A majority of the comments express concern about the negative consequences of the policy, particularly highlighting increased costs for consumers, inflation, and economic instability. Many argue that businesses will pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers, making everyday goods more expensive and disproportionately affecting middle- and lower-income households. Some also emphasize the potential for trade tensions to damage international relationships and reduce U.S. competitiveness in the global market.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments view the tariff policy more positively, suggesting that it could help stabilize the U.S. economy in the long term by reducing trade deficits and encouraging domestic production. Supporters argue that the policy could generate additional tax revenue, protect certain industries, and create jobs. However, even among these more optimistic views, some acknowledge short-term disruptions and economic uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Several commenters note that the effects of the policy are mixed, with potential benefits for some industries and job sectors but negative consequences for others, particularly small businesses and consumers. Some emphasize the complexity of the global supply chain and the difficulty of reversing long-established trade relationships, suggesting that the policy may not achieve its intended economic goals.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a general concern that the tariff policy is causing or is likely to cause more harm than good, particularly in the short term. While a few believe in the long-term potential of the policy, the majority of the discussion centers on the immediate economic burdens, inflationary pressures, and global trade tensions that the policy is creating.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 52s "}}
