Most respondents view the system as broken and in need of significant reform or complete elimination.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns About Current Tipping Culture</h6>\n<p>A dominant theme is that tipping has become excessive and intrusive. Many feel pressured to tip in situations where it seems inappropriate, such as for pickup orders, self-service transactions, or minimal service interactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with built-in tipping prompts has intensified this pressure, making it uncomfortable to decline tipping even when no meaningful service was provided.</p>\n<p>Respondents frequently criticize businesses for using tips as an excuse to underpay employees. There's strong sentiment that employers should be responsible for paying living wages rather than forcing workers to depend on customer generosity. The restaurant industry's practice of paying servers as little as $2.13 per hour is particularly criticized as exploitative.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and require businesses to pay fair, living wages to all employees. Many point to European models where service charges are included in prices and tipping is truly optional and rare.</p>\n<p>Some propose implementing a mandatory service charge (typically around 10%) instead of discretionary tipping. This would provide predictable income for workers while removing the social pressure and decision-making burden from customers.</p>\n<p>Others suggest reforms rather than elimination: limiting tipping to full-service restaurants only, making \"no tip\" options more prominent on payment screens, and ensuring tips are given only after service is rendered rather than beforehand.</p>\n<h6>Minority Perspectives</h6>\n<p>While most respondents are critical, some support the current system. These individuals appreciate the opportunity to reward excellent service and believe tipping incentivizes better performance. A few generous tippers express satisfaction with being able to help service workers directly.</p>\n<p>Some acknowledge the complexity of the issue, recognizing that while they dislike tipping culture, they continue to tip generously because workers depend on it for survival under the current system.</p>\n<h6>Overall Consensus</h6>\n<p>The predominant view is that tipping culture has expanded beyond its original purpose and now serves primarily to subsidize inadequate wages. Most respondents would prefer a system where prices reflect the true cost of service, employees receive fair compensation directly from employers, and any gratuity is genuinely voluntary and reserved for exceptional service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 8s "}}
