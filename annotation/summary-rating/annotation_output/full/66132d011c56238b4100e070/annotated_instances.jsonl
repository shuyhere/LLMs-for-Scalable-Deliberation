The most common concern was the negative impact on the nation's future, with many stating that education is the foundation of society and that defunding it would weaken the country's long-term progress and competitiveness.</p>\n<p>Participants frequently worried about the direct harm to students and educators, citing reduced opportunities, limited resources, and increased difficulty for people to afford or further their education. Many also highlighted the potential damage to research and innovation, suggesting that cuts would stifle progress in critical fields like medicine and cause a \"brain drain\" as top researchers move to other countries. A portion of these comments attributed the cuts to political motivations, suggesting it was a tactic to control the public or punish institutions with opposing views.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller percentage of participants supported the cuts. This support was primarily justified by a belief that academic institutions promote \"leftist\" or \"Marxist\" politics, and that funding reductions are a necessary response. Some also expressed trust that the administration had good reasons for the decision.</p>\n<p>A few individuals took a more nuanced or neutral position. One suggested finding a balance between cutting wasteful spending and investing in education, while another hoped the cuts might trigger a needed overhaul of the education system. A small number of participants stated they did not have enough information to form an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 32s "}}
