A significant portion of the feedback centers on the idea that tipping should be tied directly to the quality of service provided. Many argue that tipping should not be mandatory or expected in all situations, particularly in cases where service is minimal or non-existent. There is a strong sentiment that tipping should be an expression of gratitude rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>Several contributors highlight the need for a living wage for service workers, suggesting that the tipping system is often a way for employers to avoid fairly compensating their staff. There is a clear call for reform in this area, with many advocating for the complete abolition of the tipping system in favor of a model where service charges are included in the price and employees receive fair wages.</p>\n<p>Technology is also mentioned as a factor influencing tipping behavior, with some noting that point-of-sale systems often pressure customers into tipping by default. There is a desire for more transparency and control, including the ability to easily choose not to tip.</p>\n<p>Some suggest alternative models, such as a fixed tipping amount or a service charge added to the bill, to make the system more predictable and fair. A few also compare the U.S. tipping culture to other countries, suggesting that integrating service costs into the price of goods or services could be a more equitable solution.</p>\n<p>Overall, while some individuals support tipping as a way to reward good service, there is a strong consensus that the current system is flawed and in need of reform to ensure fairness for both workers and consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 46s "}}
