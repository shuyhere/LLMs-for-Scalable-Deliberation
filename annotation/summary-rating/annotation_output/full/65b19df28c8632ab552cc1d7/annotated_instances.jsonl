It is frequently described as a powerful assistant that streamlines daily routines and professional tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, planning events, and conducting research. Many see it as an evolution of search engines, providing faster, more direct answers and making it easier to learn new skills and understand complex subjects.</p>\n<p>Beyond productivity, AI is seen as a catalyst for creativity and personal growth. Individuals use it to generate ideas, create art, edit photos, and improve their writing. Some also find personal value in using it for advice on topics ranging from personal conflicts and mental health to meal planning and home improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Negative Impacts and Concerns: Trust, Privacy, and Job Security</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the benefits, there are significant concerns. A recurring theme is the erosion of trust and authenticity, with many expressing increased vigilance and skepticism toward online content, fearing the spread of misinformation and \"deepfakes.\" Privacy is another major issue, with respondents worrying about their personal data being collected and used without their knowledge.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, many express anxiety about the future, particularly regarding job security and the possibility of their skills becoming obsolete. Some also worry about becoming over-reliant on AI, which they feel could diminish critical thinking skills and personal originality. A few individuals hold a strongly negative view, associating AI with theft and actively trying to avoid it.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral or Minimal Impact</strong></p>\n<p>A smaller group of respondents state that AI has not significantly changed their lives yet. They view it as an optional tool or a form of entertainment rather than a fundamental part of their daily routine.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 56s "}}
