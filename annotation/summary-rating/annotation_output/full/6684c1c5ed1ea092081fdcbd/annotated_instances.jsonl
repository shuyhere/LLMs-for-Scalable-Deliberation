Around 70% describe clear benefits from AI in their daily lives, roughly 15\u201320% express mixed feelings (valuing usefulness but noting risks), and small minorities report little change or predominantly negative impacts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most-cited benefits:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity and time savings: A strong majority say AI streamlines routine tasks, research, planning, and work projects, freeing up time and improving output.</li>\n<li>Research and information access: Many rely on AI for quick summaries, explanations, and learning\u2014often using it as a first stop or even a replacement for traditional search.</li>\n<li>Writing and communication: A notable share use AI to draft or polish emails, letters, resumes, and to correct dictation errors and improve clarity.</li>\n<li>Creativity and visuals: Around 15% use AI for art, photo editing, design ideas, or to visualize concepts.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal benefits: Some cite help with homework, skill-building, ideation (e.g., home projects or side-income ideas), organization, and even mental health or interpersonal advice. A few mention smart-home control and personalized recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common concerns and downsides:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Privacy and data use: Repeated worries about tracking, data collection, and intrusion into personal information.</li>\n<li>Job security: A small minority fear displacement or reduced opportunities.</li>\n<li>Accuracy and bias: Some note the need to fact-check AI outputs and cite source bias.</li>\n<li>Trust and authenticity: About 10% mention deepfakes, AI-generated content, and a general erosion of trust in what they see online; a few feel anxious or hyper-vigilant about AI in creative work.</li>\n<li>Dependence and originality: A small but noticeable group limit their use to avoid overreliance or loss of personal voice and critical thinking.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Algorithmic effects: Isolated mentions of increased social media addiction tied to AI-driven feeds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How people are adapting:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many treat AI as an assistant or co-pilot\u2014useful but requiring verification.</li>\n<li>Some are enthusiastic daily users; others use it sparingly for specific tasks.</li>\n<li>A minority avoid AI content where possible, especially in creative domains.</li>\n<li>There are calls for sensible guardrails and regulation to balance innovation with safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Net takeaway: Most respondents experience tangible gains in efficiency, learning, and creativity, often making AI their go-to tool for information and task support. At the same time, meaningful concerns\u2014especially around privacy, authenticity, and dependence\u2014temper enthusiasm, leading to cautious, purpose-driven use and interest in stronger safeguards.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 52s "}}
