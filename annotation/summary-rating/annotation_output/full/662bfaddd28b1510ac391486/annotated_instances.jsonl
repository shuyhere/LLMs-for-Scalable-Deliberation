Supporters frequently argue that universal healthcare would improve public health outcomes, prevent medical bankruptcy, and align the U.S. with practices in other developed nations. Many emphasize that the current system is prohibitively expensive, inefficient, and fails to provide equitable access, often linking healthcare to concepts of social responsibility, national security, and economic fairness.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express conditional support or opposition. Some supporters advocate for a dual system that includes both public and private options, while others emphasize the need for timely and efficient care delivery. A minority of respondents oppose government-provided healthcare, citing concerns about increased costs, reduced quality, longer wait times, and excessive government control. These commenters generally prefer private sector solutions or express skepticism about the government's ability to manage healthcare effectively.</p>\n<p>Frequent themes across the comments include the moral imperative to ensure care for all, comparisons to other countries' healthcare systems, and frustration with the current high costs and inefficiencies. The belief that healthcare is a basic right and essential for a functioning society is a dominant perspective.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
