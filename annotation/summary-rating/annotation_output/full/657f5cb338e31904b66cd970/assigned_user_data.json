Many highlight that consumers are already experiencing price increases on everyday goods, with particular worry about the impact on middle-class families and those already struggling financially. Several commenters emphasize that companies typically pass tariff costs directly to consumers rather than absorbing them, effectively making tariffs a \"tax on the people.\"</p>\n<p>Small business owners report being particularly affected, with some noting they can no longer afford to import necessary materials and products for their operations. Others in logistics and shipping industries describe seeing decreased package volumes and reduced work opportunities as customers become more hesitant to make purchases.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Economic Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>While many see immediate negative effects, some respondents believe the tariffs could yield positive results over time. These optimistic voices argue that tariffs will help level the playing field with other nations, bring additional revenue to the U.S. treasury, and potentially encourage domestic manufacturing.
