The most frequently cited reason is the belief that tariffs lead to price increases for consumers, as companies pass on the extra costs. Many feel this amounts to a tax on everyday Americans, making life more difficult, especially for those already struggling financially. Other common concerns include damage to international trade relationships, the potential for retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and specific harm to small businesses. Some also expressed the view that the policy is ineffective at bringing jobs back to the U.S. and tarnishes the country's reputation as a fair trading partner.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of commentators view the tariff policy in a positive light. The primary argument from this group is that the policy will yield long-term benefits for the U.S. economy, even if there are short-term difficulties. Supporters believe the tariffs are a necessary measure to correct unfair trade imbalances and hold other countries accountable. They argue that the policy will make American products more competitive, encourage domestic manufacturing, and ultimately help American workers. Some also expressed confidence in the administration's business expertise to secure a better economic future for the country.</p>\n<p>A few commentators offered a mixed or neutral perspective. They noted that the policy likely has both positive and negative effects, such as protecting certain domestic industries while simultaneously raising costs for consumers and other businesses. One person suggested that the policy may not have a significant impact at all, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 59s "}}
