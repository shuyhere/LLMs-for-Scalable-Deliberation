About 80% oppose the cuts, roughly 17% express mixed or uncertain views, and a very small share support them.\n- Main concerns from opponents: Education is viewed as foundational to the country\u2019s future; cuts are seen as harming students (especially low-income), limiting access and quality, undermining educators and school resources, and damaging research and innovation (including medical). Many warn of long-term economic and competitiveness losses, potential brain drain to other countries, and erosion of trust in institutions. Some also frame the move as politically motivated or authoritarian and worry about disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities.\n- Supportive or mixed perspectives: A minority believe reductions are justified due to perceived ideological bias or waste in academia, express trust that leadership has valid reasons, or hope cuts could spur reform and reduce student debt. Several call for details, urge a balanced approach that targets waste while maintaining critical education and research funding, and emphasize the need for alternatives if cuts proceed.\n- Tone: Predominantly urgent and critical, with strong language from opponents; a smaller share is cautious, conditional, or neutral.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 0s "}}
