Several call for details, urge a balanced approach that targets waste while maintaining critical education and research funding, and emphasize the need for alternatives if cuts proceed.\n- Tone: Predominantly urgent and critical, with strong language from opponents; a smaller share is cautious, conditional, or neutral.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "type": "comparison", "model": "comparison", "num_samples_group": 30, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": "qwen3-32b", "model_b": "gpt-5", "summary_a_id": "013e5e06de3f5fd5", "summary_b_id": "7f9557663848bca4", "summary_a_text": "The comments reflect a broad spectrum of opinions regarding the decision to cut academic funding, with the majority expressing strong opposition.
