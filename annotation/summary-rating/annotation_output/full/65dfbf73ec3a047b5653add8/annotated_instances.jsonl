The most frequently cited worry is that tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers, as businesses pass on the additional costs. Many note that these price increases are already being felt and will disproportionately affect middle-class Americans and those already struggling economically. Several comments emphasize that tariffs effectively function as a tax on consumers rather than on foreign countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Economic Effects</strong></p>\n<p>Respondents are skeptical about the policy's ability to achieve its stated goals. Multiple comments point out that reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. is extremely difficult given the dismantling of domestic factories and supply chains over previous decades. Some note that companies are finding ways to circumvent the tariffs rather than bringing production back to America. Economic concerns include predictions of reduced GDP, lower wages, potential recession, and overall economic instability.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Several comments highlight concerns about deteriorating relationships with trading partners, particularly China. Respondents worry that the tariff policy damages America's reputation as a fair trading partner and may push the country toward economic isolation. Some note that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading arrangements that exclude the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>A smaller portion of respondents view the tariffs positively, arguing that they will benefit the U.S. economy in the long term. Supporters believe the policy will help stabilize the economy by ensuring other countries pay their \"fair share\" and reduce U.S. debt. Some express hope that tariffs will encourage Americans to buy domestic products and eventually strengthen local industries. A few comments suggest that while there may be short-term challenges, the long-term benefits will justify the policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed and Uncertain Views</strong></p>\n<p>Some respondents acknowledge the complexity of the issue, noting that tariffs may have mixed effects - benefiting certain industries while harming others. A few comments suggest the actual impact remains unclear, with some arguing the tariffs aren't having much effect at all due to workarounds.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect substantial concern about the current tariff policy, with most respondents anticipating negative consequences for consumer prices, economic growth, and international trade relationships. The minority who support the policy tend to focus on potential long-term benefits and the principle of economic fairness in international trade.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 43s "}}
