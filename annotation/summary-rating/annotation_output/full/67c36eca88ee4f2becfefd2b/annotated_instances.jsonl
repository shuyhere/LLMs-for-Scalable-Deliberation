Many argue that tipping should not be necessary if workers are paid a <strong>livable wage</strong>, as is the case in some European countries. Others propose replacing tipping with a <strong>compulsory service charge</strong> (e.g., 10%) to ensure fair compensation without placing the burden on customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Social Pressure and Expectations</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the <strong>feeling of obligation</strong> to tip, even when service is minimal or not directly received. Many commenters express discomfort with being <strong>asked to tip before or during service</strong>, particularly in fast food or self-service settings. Some feel that tipping has become <strong>over-expected</strong> and <strong>invasive</strong>, especially with digital prompts that make it difficult to decline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Reflection of Service Quality</strong><br />\n   A number of individuals support tipping as a way to <strong>reward good service</strong>, but emphasize that it should be <strong>optional</strong> and <strong>based on the quality of service provided</strong>. Some suggest that <strong>fixed tip amounts</strong> or <strong>tangible rewards</strong> (e.g., thank-you notes, coupons) could improve the system and reduce confusion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Fair Wages and Employer Responsibility</strong><br />\n   A strong sentiment is that <strong>employers should be responsible for paying fair wages</strong>, and that <strong>tipping should not be a substitute</strong> for proper compensation. Many argue that the current system allows businesses to <strong>underpay workers</strong>, forcing them to rely on customer generosity to make ends meet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping in Certain Contexts</strong><br />\n   While many oppose the tipping system in general, some commenters believe it is <strong>appropriate in full-service settings</strong>, such as sit-down restaurants, where <strong>direct service is provided</strong>. However, even in these cases, they often advocate for <strong>making tipping optional</strong> and <strong>not implied</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Regional Differences</strong><br />\n   Several commenters note that tipping is <strong>not a universal practice</strong> and suggest adopting models from other countries where <strong>tipping is either optional or nonexistent</strong>. They argue that the U.S. system is <strong>out of step</strong> with global norms and is often <strong>misapplied</strong> to situations where it is not warranted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Tipping Culture</strong><br />\n   Some view tipping as a <strong>form of consumer exploitation</strong> or <strong>social pressure</strong> that can lead to <strong>inappropriate expectations</strong> from service workers. Others feel that it can be <strong>used as a tool for ego or social status</strong>, rather than a genuine expression of gratitude.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Desire for Simplicity and Transparency</strong><br />\n   Many commenters wish for a more <strong>streamlined and transparent system</strong>, where tipping is <strong>clearly optional</strong>, <strong>not forced</strong>, and <strong>not tied to unnecessary service interactions</strong>. Some suggest that <strong>removing tipping prompts</strong> or <strong>standardizing service charges</strong> could help reduce confusion and pressure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed or Ambivalent Views</strong><br />\n   A few individuals express <strong>conflicted opinions</strong>, acknowledging the need for fair wages for workers while also recognizing the <strong>burden tipping places on consumers</strong>. They suggest a <strong>middle ground</strong> where workers are paid fairly, and tipping is <strong>optional and meaningful</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the majority of feedback reflects a <strong>desire for a more equitable system</strong> where service workers are paid fairly and tipping is <strong>not mandatory or socially pressured</strong>.

Participants consistently report feeling pressured by ubiquitous digital payment screens requesting tips for minimal or no service interactions.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns About Current System</h6>\n<p>A significant majority of respondents express frustration with what they perceive as \"tipping creep\" - the expansion of tipping expectations into transactions that previously didn't involve gratuities. Many specifically mention being prompted to tip at counter service establishments, pickup orders, and basic retail transactions. The phrase \"out of control\" appears frequently throughout the responses.</p>\n<p>The pressure created by point-of-sale systems emerges as a particular pain point. Respondents describe feeling uncomfortable declining tips when presented with digital screens, especially when employees are watching. Several mention the awkwardness of navigating multiple screens to select a no-tip option.</p>\n<h6>Wage and Economic Concerns</h6>\n<p>A dominant theme centers on the relationship between tipping and wages. Most participants believe employers use tipping as an excuse to underpay workers, shifting compensation responsibility to customers. Many specifically reference the $2.13 hourly wage for tipped workers, viewing this as exploitative. There's widespread support for establishing living wages that would reduce or eliminate workers' dependence on tips.</p>\n<p>Participants also express concern about the economic burden on both sides - customers feeling financially strained by expanding tip expectations, and workers facing income uncertainty due to variable tips.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion is complete elimination of tipping in favor of fair wages paid directly by employers. Many reference European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices or tipping is minimal.</p>\n<p>Other frequently mentioned improvements include:\n- Making tipping truly optional without pressure\n- Limiting tip requests to full-service situations only\n- Implementing automatic service charges (typically 10%) instead of variable tips\n- Ensuring easy \"no tip\" options on payment screens\n- Allowing tips only after service is rendered and can be evaluated</p>\n<h6>Minority Perspectives</h6>\n<p>While most responses are critical, a smaller portion of participants support tipping when it rewards exceptional service or helps workers earn above minimum wage. Some view generous tipping as a personal responsibility given current wage structures. A few respondents always tip substantially, viewing it as supporting workers in demanding jobs.</p>\n<h6>Cultural and Systemic Issues</h6>\n<p>Many participants frame tipping as a uniquely American problem, noting that most other countries have different compensation models. There's recognition that changing the system would require fundamental shifts in how service industries operate and price their offerings. Several respondents indicate willingness to pay higher base prices if it meant elimination of tipping and fair worker wages.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a system that many view as broken - one that creates discomfort for customers, uncertainty for workers, and allows employers to shift compensation responsibilities. While approaches to reform vary, there's clear consensus that the current tipping culture has become problematic and needs substantial change.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 29s "}}
