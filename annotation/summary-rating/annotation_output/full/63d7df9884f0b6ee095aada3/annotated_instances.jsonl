It\u2019s widely valued for research support\u2014summarizing sources, surfacing key information, and helping learn technical topics\u2014sometimes described as akin to how search engines used to feel. Some note personal benefits such as aid in conflict reflection and general amusement. Older users highlight a smoother learning and idea-generation process compared with pre-digital methods. However, several caution that AI can be inaccurate, biased in source selection, or only \u201csometimes helpful,\u201d requiring fact-checking.
