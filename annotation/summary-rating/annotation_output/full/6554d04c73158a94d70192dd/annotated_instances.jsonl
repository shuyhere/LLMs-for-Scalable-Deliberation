Roughly 73% describe harmful effects, about 16% see benefits, and around 11% express mixed or conditional views.</li>\n<li>Main concerns (negative):</li>\n<li>Higher consumer prices and inflation as tariffs are passed through to buyers; reduced purchasing power and potential recessionary effects.</li>\n<li>Disproportionate harm to small businesses and import-reliant sectors; reports of delayed/canceled shipments and tighter margins.</li>\n<li>Limited evidence of reshoring; firms can work around tariffs or \u201cwait it out,\u201d with uncertainty deterring investment.</li>\n<li>Risk of retaliation, strained relations (especially with China), erosion of U.S. soft power, and damage to global competitiveness.</li>\n<li>Distributional worries: burden falls on middle- and lower-income households; some fear rising food and essential goods costs.</li>\n<li>Perceived benefits (positive):</li>\n<li>Potential protection for domestic industries, improved competitiveness of U.S. products, and encouragement to \u201cbuy American.\u201d</li>\n<li>Increased tariff revenue and leverage to negotiate better trade terms; possible narrowing of trade deficits.</li>\n<li>Some expect short-term pain but long-term gains if domestic capacity builds.</li>\n<li>Mixed/conditional perspectives:</li>\n<li>Impact may depend on policy design (targeted vs broad), stability, and complementary measures; some see limited effect due to corporate workarounds.</li>\n<li>Several anticipate short-term negatives with a chance of longer-term benefits, contingent on successful reshoring and calmer trade relations.</li>\n<li>Lived experiences:</li>\n<li>Frequent mentions of rising everyday costs and pressure on household budgets.</li>\n<li>Small business owners cite higher input costs and reduced access to overseas supplies.</li>\n<li>A few note perceived increases in treasury revenues or investor opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: The conversation leans strongly toward expecting net negative outcomes\u2014primarily via higher prices, uncertainty, and international frictions\u2014while a smaller share emphasizes strategic, long-run advantages such as industry protection, bargaining leverage, and potential deficit reduction.
