Many express frustration, feeling that frequent updates pressure consumers to upgrade constantly, shorten device lifespans, and prioritize manufacturer profits over product durability. Some note that this cycle leads to increased costs, electronic waste, and unnecessary accessory purchases due to changing standards. However, a minority view recognizes benefits such as innovation, improved security, and convenience, appreciating how technology progress enhances access to information. There is also a sense that update cycles may naturally slow as technological advances become less dramatic, with several suggesting that longer intervals between major releases would be more consumer-friendly and sustainable.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 12s "}}
