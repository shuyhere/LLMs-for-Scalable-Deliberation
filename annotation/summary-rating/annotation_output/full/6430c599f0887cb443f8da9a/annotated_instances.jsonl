Several worry about misinformation, echo chambers, and people uncritically adopting influencer viewpoints.\n- Social and cultural critiques include unease with parasocial investment, pay disparities versus traditional professions, and fears that youth see influencing as \u201ceasy money\u201d over education or skilled trades.\n- Many argue legitimacy requires higher standards: transparency about sponsorships and AI, accountability for harms, media literacy for audiences, and potentially regulation, fair contracts, or creator protections to address algorithm volatility and burnout.\n- There\u2019s ambivalence about influencers as news sources: some praise broader access and independence from legacy media; others warn against relying on them as primary news without verification.\n- Contextual notes: the field surged during the pandemic, is often compared to celebrity culture with more intimacy, and is viewed as a natural evolution of how people consume content and make purchasing decisions\u2014valid if done responsibly, but not a guaranteed or universally beneficial career path.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
