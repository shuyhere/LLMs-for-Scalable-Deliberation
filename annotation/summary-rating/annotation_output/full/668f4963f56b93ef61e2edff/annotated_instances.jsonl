A significant portion of respondents express frustration with the expectation of tipping for minimal or no service, especially at establishments like fast-food or counter-service restaurants where tipping was not traditionally expected. Many feel that the proliferation of digital payment systems has made tipping feel more pressured and intrusive.</p>\n<p>There is a strong consensus that employers should pay a living wage, eliminating the need for workers to rely heavily on tips for their income. This was frequently cited as a necessary change to reduce the financial burden on consumers and provide more stable earnings for service workers.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the tipping system itself are divided. Some support tipping as a voluntary reward for exceptional service, while a notable portion advocate for its complete abolition, suggesting it be replaced with higher menu prices, a mandatory service charge, or a higher base wage for employees. A smaller percentage of comments defend the current system, viewing tips as an important incentive for good service or a necessary supplement for underpaid workers, though even these often acknowledge the system's flaws.</p>\n<p>Sentiment also varies on how tips should be calculated, with some preferring a shift from percentages to fixed amounts. The overarching theme is a desire for a system that is less obligatory, more transparent, and where gratuities are truly a reflection of service quality rather than a social expectation or a subsidy for low wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
