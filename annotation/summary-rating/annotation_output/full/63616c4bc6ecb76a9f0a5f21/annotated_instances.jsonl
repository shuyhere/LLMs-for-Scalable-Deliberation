The most frequently cited reason is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege that should be tied to income or employment.</p>\n<p>Many supporters argue that the current market-based system is failing. They describe it as \"wildly expensive\" and inaccessible, forcing individuals to choose between medical care and other basic necessities, or risk incurring a lifetime of medical debt. Several commenters pointed out that the United States is an outlier among developed nations for not offering universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. should follow the successful models of other countries. The economic and social benefits of a healthier population were also highlighted, with some viewing it as a matter of national security and global competitiveness.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some commenters offered nuanced or conditional approval. A portion of participants advocated for a \"public option\" that would exist alongside private insurance, preserving consumer choice rather than creating a single-payer system. Others specified their support was for <em>basic</em> care, expressing concern that <em>extensive</em> government involvement could lead to unwanted monitoring or bureaucracy. The importance of timely access to care was also raised as a critical condition for support.</p>\n<p>A small minority of commenters opposed the idea. Their arguments centered on the belief that the government is inefficient and that the private sector is better suited to ensure high-quality care. These participants also expressed concerns about fostering greater dependency on the government and the principle that \"nothing in life is free.\"</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 55s "}}
