This has created a sense of pressure and obligation rather than a voluntary gesture of appreciation.</p>\n<p>While some still believe tipping should be a reward for excellent and above-and-beyond service, the overwhelming sentiment is that it should not be a substitute for fair wages. The most common proposed solution is to abolish the current tipping system entirely. This would be replaced by a model where businesses pay all employees a stable, livable wage, even if it results in higher menu prices. Other suggested alternatives include implementing a mandatory service charge, as seen in other countries, or making tipping truly optional and less prominent during transactions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
