Universities and their students are by far the most undeservedly hyper-privileged people on Earth, sitting on billions in endowments they did little to earn while demanding funding from the same working people they teach their students to hate; and it is the universities, not Trump, who constantly silence and threaten their political enemies, while Trump justly prevents the theft of our taxes by privileged academic aristocrats who think they can steal money from the working class with no one's consent while giving the country nothing but poison and propaganda in return.
