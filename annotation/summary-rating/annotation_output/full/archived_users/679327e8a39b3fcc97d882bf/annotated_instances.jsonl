{"id": "triplet_1667_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Based on the comments provided, here is an overall summary:</p>\n<p>Overall, there is a broad acceptance of internet influencing as a recognized profession, though this acceptance is often accompanied by significant reservations and critiques.</p>\n<p>A positive viewpoint highlights that influencing is a valid entrepreneurial path that allows creators to earn a living doing something they enjoy. These commentators see influencers as a modern evolution of media, serving as a source of entertainment, information, product recommendations, and even news. They are often compared to celebrities of the past but seen as more relatable and accessible. This shift is viewed by some as a positive democratization of media, taking power away from traditional gatekeepers and allowing everyday people to build a platform.</p>\n<p>However, there is a strong undercurrent of skepticism and criticism. Many feel the profession is oversaturated, leading to a lack of originality and a culture where everyone follows the same trends. A significant number of comments question the authenticity of influencers, describing them as annoying, disingenuous, and primarily motivated by money. There are also deep concerns about their societal impact, including the promotion of overconsumption, the potential for spreading misinformation, and a perceived negative effect on the aspirations of young people, who might be drawn to an \"easy\" path to success rather than traditional education or careers. Some express a more philosophical concern that the focus on personal branding leads to social fragmentation.</p>\n<p>Bridging these two perspectives is a balanced view that acknowledges influencing as a legitimate, and often difficult, job while also calling for greater responsibility and accountability. Commenters in this group believe that because influencers have a tangible impact on their audiences, they must be mindful of the content they create and the messages they send. The need for transparency and integrity is a recurring theme for the profession's continued legitimacy.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
