{"id": "triplet_487_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Here is a summary of the comments provided:</p>\n<p>A majority of commenters support government enforcement of public health measures like quarantines and vaccinations. The primary reason for this support is the belief that such measures are essential for public health, serving the greater good by preventing the spread of disease. Some draw on recent experiences with the pandemic, arguing that vaccination helps society return to normal more quickly. Another point is that enforcement is necessary to counteract individual decisions that could put the wider population at risk. One supporter offered a conditional view, stating that enforcement is especially important early in a pandemic when a virus is not well understood.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller percentage of comments oppose these mandates. Reasons for this opposition center on individual liberty, vaccine safety, and the perceived ineffectiveness of mandates. Some argue that while encouragement is acceptable, enforcement infringes on personal beliefs. Others express specific concerns about the rapid development and potential side effects of vaccines, suggesting they were not studied long enough. A final point of opposition is the view that mandates are pointless, as people will ultimately do what they want regardless of the rules.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 19s "}}
