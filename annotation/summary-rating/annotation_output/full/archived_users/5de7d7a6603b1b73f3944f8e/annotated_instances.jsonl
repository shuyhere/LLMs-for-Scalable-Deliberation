These supporters frequently argue that the current private, for-profit system is failing, leading to prohibitive costs, medical debt, and preventable suffering. They point to the success of universal healthcare systems in other developed nations as a model the U.S. should follow. A common sentiment is that access to care should not be dependent on income or employment status, and that a government system would improve public health outcomes and be more efficient and cost-effective for society as a whole.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express opposition or significant reservations. The primary concerns center on a belief that government involvement would be inefficient, reduce the quality of care, and lead to increased wait times. Some opponents prefer a system that retains a strong role for private insurance and individual choice. Another portion of comments express conditional or partial support, advocating for a hybrid system that includes a public option alongside private alternatives, or emphasizing that any government plan must ensure care is both accessible and timely to be effective.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>There is strong support for government-provided basic health insurance, with many viewing healthcare as a fundamental human right rather than a privilege. Numerous comments highlight concerns about the current system's high costs, lack of accessibility, and the financial burden leading to medical debt or avoidance of care.

Others emphasize the economic benefits, suggesting it could be more efficient and cost-effective overall, prevent bankruptcies, and allow for better preventive care. A few express conditional support, advocating for a system that ensures timely care or is implemented alongside private options.</p>\n<p>A minority oppose government-provided insurance, citing concerns about potential inefficiency, reduced quality of care, increased wait times, and excessive government control. Some in this group prefer a system focused on making private insurance more affordable rather than providing a universal government plan.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 5s "}}
