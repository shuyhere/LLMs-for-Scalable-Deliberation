A significant portion of respondents express frustration with the current state of tipping culture in the United States.</p>\n<h3>Main Concerns About Current Tipping Culture</h3>\n<p>Many commenters feel that tipping has become excessive and invasive, particularly with digital payment systems that prompt for tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. Common complaints include being asked to tip for counter service, pickup orders, and minimal-service transactions. Several people describe feeling pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping through awkward point-of-sale interfaces that make it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<h3>The Wage Issue</h3>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Many respondents believe the fundamental problem is that employers use tipping as an excuse to pay workers below a living wage, particularly in the restaurant industry where servers may earn as little as $2.13 per hour. There's widespread agreement that workers should receive fair base wages rather than depending on tips for survival.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on Reform</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improving the system is eliminating tipping altogether and requiring employers to pay living wages. Some propose adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices. Others suggest compromises such as making tipping truly optional, limiting tip requests to full-service situations, or implementing flat service charges instead of percentage-based tips.</p>\n<h3>Support for Tipping</h3>\n<p>Despite the criticism, some respondents strongly support tipping, viewing it as a way to reward excellent service and help workers earn more than minimum wage. These supporters often emphasize tipping generously (with some mentioning 20-30% as appropriate) and see it as an incentive for employees to provide better service.</p>\n<h3>Middle Ground Perspectives</h3>\n<p>Many commenters occupy a middle position - they don't object to tipping for genuine service (such as table service or delivery) but resist the expansion of tipping to every transaction. They distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus forced, and many express a desire for tipping to return to being a genuine expression of gratitude rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment suggests that while people want service workers to be fairly compensated, the current tipping system is viewed as problematic, with most preferring either significant reform or complete elimination in favor of fair wages.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "num_samples_group": 90, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><h2>Summary of Comments on the Tipping System</h2>\n<p>The comments reveal deeply divided opinions about tipping, with perspectives ranging from strong support to complete opposition.
