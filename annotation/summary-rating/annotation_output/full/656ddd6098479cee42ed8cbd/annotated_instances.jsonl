A significant portion of the feedback supports eliminating or reforming the current system, particularly in situations where tipping feels mandatory or inapplicable. Some suggest removing the tipping system entirely, especially where it is not relevant to the service provided, while others advocate for making tipping voluntary and eliminating forced or implied tipping.</p>\n<p>Several commenters emphasize the need for fair wages for service workers, arguing that tipping should not be a substitute for a livable hourly wage. This reflects a common concern that many tipped workers rely heavily on tips to make ends meet, and the system can be unreliable or unfair.</p>\n<p>Others propose alternative approaches to tipping, such as shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping, or offering tangible rewards or recognition for customers who choose to tip, such as thank-you notes or coupons. There is also a general sentiment that tipping should be based on the quality of service, and that customers should have the flexibility to tip what they can, especially in times of financial constraint.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback suggests a desire for a more equitable and less coercive system that respects both workers and customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 7s "}}
