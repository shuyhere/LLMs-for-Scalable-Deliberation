Respondents argued that in a wealthy, developed nation, no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities like food or shelter.</p>\n<p><strong>International comparisons:</strong> A significant percentage of comments pointed to other developed countries that successfully provide universal healthcare, noting that the United States is an outlier among \"first world\" nations in not offering this benefit to its citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic concerns:</strong> Respondents frequently highlighted the prohibitive cost of private health insurance and medical care, mentioning that medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy.

The high cost and inadequate access of the current private system are frequently criticized, with several comparisons made to other developed nations that successfully provide universal care.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express reservations or opposition, primarily concerned about government inefficiency, potential degradation of care quality, and increased taxpayer burden.
