Many commenters highlight the <strong>democratization of media</strong>, the ability to <strong>earn a living from passion</strong>, and the <strong>influence on trends and information dissemination</strong>. Some note that influencers can be <strong>entertaining, informative, and even socially or politically impactful</strong>, especially in areas where traditional media may fall short.</p>\n<p>A smaller but notable share of comments express <strong>skepticism or criticism</strong>, often pointing to concerns about <strong>authenticity, misinformation, and the commercialization of personal life</strong>.
