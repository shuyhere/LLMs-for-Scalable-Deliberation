About 20% offer mixed or conditional views, acknowledging concerns about perceived ideological bias in academia or expressing trust that alternatives might exist, but still warning that cuts without viable replacements would degrade outcomes. Roughly 10% are unsure and request more details before forming an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 19s "}}
