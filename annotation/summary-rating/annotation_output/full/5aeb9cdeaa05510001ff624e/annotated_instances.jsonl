Many participants emphasize empathy, noting they would want a safe haven if they were in similar circumstances. Supporters highlight that refugees are innocent victims who didn't choose their circumstances and deserve safety and opportunities for a better life. Some argue that America's resources should be used to help those in need, viewing it as a moral obligation to protect those facing persecution or death.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition and concerns</strong> center mainly on economic and resource allocation issues. Critics argue that America should prioritize its own citizens first, particularly given national debt and existing domestic challenges. Some express frustration that resources go to refugees while American citizens are denied assistance. Concerns about long-term economic impacts are raised, including the strain on government systems and increasing costs as refugee populations grow over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Middle ground positions</strong> suggest conditional acceptance with specific requirements. Several participants support refugee acceptance but advocate for:\n- Thorough vetting processes to determine legitimate refugee status\n- Clear limits to prevent negative impacts on citizens' quality of life<br />\n- Better integration programs including education about American society and rules\n- More careful qualification criteria for refugee status</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a tension between humanitarian impulses and practical concerns about resources and national priorities, with many seeking a balanced approach that addresses both compassionate and pragmatic considerations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 17s "}}
