Some participants express feelings of being upset or viewing this as part of a broader pattern of harmful policies. A few commenters admit to having limited knowledge about the specifics but still express concern based on general principles about education funding.</p>\n<h3>Neutral and Uncertain Views</h3>\n<p>A small minority express uncertainty or neutral positions, with some indicating they need more information before forming an opinion.
