Several noted that the U.S. already struggles with education access and literacy rates, making cuts particularly damaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Innovation Consequences</strong>\nA significant portion of comments focused on the detrimental effects on research, particularly in critical areas like medical research and cancer studies.

Many viewed research as essential for innovation that \"can save billions of dollars and lives.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term National Impact</strong>\nCommenters frequently described the cuts as \"short-sighted\" and harmful to America's future.
