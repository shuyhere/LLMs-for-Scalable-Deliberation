Many feel it is a moral obligation to help those in life-threatening situations, putting themselves in the refugees' shoes and highlighting that everyone deserves a safe and good life. Some participants believe the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees, either due to its abundance of resources, its historical identity as a nation of immigrants, or as a way to atone for the impact of its foreign policy.
