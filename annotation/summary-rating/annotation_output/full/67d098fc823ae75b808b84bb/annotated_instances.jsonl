A significant percentage of commenters emphasize the need for thorough vetting processes to ensure security and proper integration. Concerns are frequently raised about economic strain, resource allocation, and prioritizing existing citizens' needs before accepting refugees. Some oppose increased refugee intake, citing current national challenges, while others advocate for it based on historical identity, global responsibility, or reparations for foreign policy. A small percentage call for open borders or categorize refugee acceptance as a fundamental human right.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 38s "}}
