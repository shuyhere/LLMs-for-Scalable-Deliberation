Many argue that reducing funding undermines the quality of education, limits opportunities for students and researchers, and hampers innovation and long-term competitiveness. Concerns are also raised about the potential for brain drain, where talented researchers might seek opportunities elsewhere, and the negative impact on vulnerable students who rely on financial support to afford education. A few comments suggest that while there may be some justification for reducing funding due to political concerns, such cuts risk stifling independent thinking. One comment reflects uncertainty about the issue due to a lack of detailed information. Overall, the sentiment is that sustained investment in education is essential for societal and economic well-being.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
