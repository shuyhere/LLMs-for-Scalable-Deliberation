Around 55% opposed requiring real-name registration, about 35% supported it, and roughly 10% offered mixed or conditional views.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main reasons for opposition:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Privacy and safety: fear of doxxing, stalking, domestic abuse risks, harassment, data breaches, identity theft, and real-world retaliation (e.g., from employers or in hostile political environments).</li>\n<li>Free expression: concerns about chilling effects on speech, silencing marginalized or vulnerable voices, and eroding anonymity as a core internet value.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Distrust and feasibility: skepticism about tech companies/governments collecting and using personal data, potential data sales, surveillance, and doubts that real-name rules would stop bad actors (who could fake IDs or use stolen identities).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main reasons for support:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Accountability and civility: expectation that tying identities to accounts would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, hate speech, misinformation, impersonation, scams, catfishing, bots, and exploitation (including protection of minors and trafficking concerns).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authenticity and enforcement: belief that real identities improve trust, help investigations, and deter harmful behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Middle-ground ideas:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Platform choice rather than government mandates.</li>\n<li>Private verification (back-office/KYC) with the option to use a public pseudonym; visible \u201cverified\u201d badges.</li>\n<li>Targeted or optional requirements (e.g., for high-reach accounts, businesses, or specific risk areas), with exemptions for vulnerable users.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strong data protection standards, transparency, and limited data retention to mitigate breach and misuse risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key trade-off noted:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Safety and accountability vs. privacy and freedom of expression, with many concerned that strict real-name policies could cause unintended harm while offering uncertain effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 7s "}}
