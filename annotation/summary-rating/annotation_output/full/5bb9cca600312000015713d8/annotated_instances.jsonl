Supporters argue that it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, and help prevent harmful behaviors such as impersonation, misinformation, and scams.

Opponents raise concerns about privacy, noting that requiring real names could expose users to doxxing, stalking, harassment, and identity theft. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression, especially for vulnerable groups such as victims of domestic abuse, political dissidents, or individuals in repressive environments.

About 57% opposed requiring real-name registration, roughly 33% supported it, and around 10% offered conditional or mixed views.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for opposing\n- Privacy and safety: Strong concerns about doxxing, stalking, harassment, domestic abuse situations, and exposure in hostile or restrictive environments.\n- Free expression and reputational risk: Fear of job loss, social or political backlash, and a chilling effect on speech.\n- Data security and trust: Worries about hacks, data breaches, government access, and platforms selling or misusing personal data.\n- Identity theft and fraud: Requiring more PII was seen as increasing risk rather than reducing it.\n- Limited effectiveness: Belief that determined bad actors can fake identities, use stolen IDs, or create multiple accounts; enforcement seen as impractical.\n- Participation costs: Some would reduce or stop using social media if forced to reveal their real identity.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for supporting\n- Accountability and civility: Expectation that tying accounts to real identities would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, hate, and misinformation.\n- Safety and integrity: Hoped-for reductions in scams, bots, catfishing, and impersonation; easier investigations; protection of minors; more credibility and authenticity.\n- Emerging risks: Concern that advances (e.g., AI misuse) heighten the need for verification.</p>\n<p>Conditional/compromise ideas\n- Platform-led, not government-mandated: Preference for platform verification over state requirements.\n- Backend verification with public pseudonyms: KYC-like checks held privately by platforms, with real names hidden unless there\u2019s abuse or legal need.\n- Optional verification: Voluntary \u201cverified\u201d badges for individuals, public figures, or businesses; encourage rather than coerce.\n- Strong safeguards: Data minimization, strict access controls, transparency, and due process for unmasking.</p>\n<p>Bottom line\n- Many value accountability benefits, but a larger share prioritize privacy, safety, and feasibility concerns. There is notable openness to privacy-preserving verification (optional or backend-only) rather than blanket, public real-name mandates.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}
