Several argue it could be more efficient and cheaper overall, help economic competitiveness, and ensure hospitals are paid.\n- Common conditions and preferences among supporters: Ensure timely, high-quality care; consider a public option alongside private plans (preserve choice); focus on \u201cbasic\u201d coverage, with some urging inclusion of dental and vision; make it affordable for typical earners; some note coverage should prioritize citizens/taxpayers.\n- Minority opposition: A small share opposes on grounds of government inefficiency, potential declines in quality, higher taxpayer costs, expanded dependency on government, and the trade-off with other public services.\n- Notable themes: Frustration with current costs and access barriers; comparisons to countries like Canada; concerns about for-profit insurers\u2019 incentives; suggestions to build on Medicare infrastructure; differing views on whether participation should be mandatory or optional.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
