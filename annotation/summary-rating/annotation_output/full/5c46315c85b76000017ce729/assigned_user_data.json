Many emphasized that education is fundamental to society's success and that cutting funding undermines opportunities for both young students and adults seeking to further their education. Concerns were raised about limiting access to college for those who cannot afford it, reduced resources for learning, and the potential decline in education quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Innovation</strong>\nMany participants highlighted the detrimental effects on research capabilities, particularly in critical areas like medical research and cancer studies. Respondents worried that funding cuts would cause researchers to leave for other countries, weakening America's competitive position in science and innovation. The loss of research funding was seen as having long-term negative consequences for technological advancement and economic growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term National Consequences</strong>\nA substantial portion of comments focused on the broader implications for America's future.
