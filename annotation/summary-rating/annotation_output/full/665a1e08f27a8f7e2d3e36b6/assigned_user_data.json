Many argue education is foundational to a healthy society and economy, and cuts would harm students (especially low-income and adult learners), educators, and research. Expected consequences include reduced innovation, slowed medical and scientific progress, worsened skill gaps, weaker global competitiveness, brain drain to other countries, and diminished social mobility.\n- Specific concerns raised: Potential damage to public health and critical research (e.g., cancer and medical studies), fewer opportunities in both STEM and non-STEM fields, pressure on smaller academic departments, and long-term economic costs that outweigh short-term savings. Some mention constitutional/process issues if funds were already appropriated by Congress and worry about erosion of trust in institutions.\n- Motive and tone: Many critics describe the move as short-sighted, politically motivated, or punitive toward universities; a portion frame it as an authoritarian tactic to keep the public less informed. Emotions run high, with frustration and alarm common.\n- Minority/supportive perspectives: Some believe cuts are justified due to perceived ideological bias, politicization, or inefficiency in academia; they argue funds are misused, federal involvement inflates costs, and state/local control or targeted reductions could improve accountability. A few express trust that the administration has valid reasons or that cuts could catalyze needed reforms.\n- Middle-ground/conditional views: Some call for trimming waste without undermining core teaching, research, and student aid; they favor balanced, evidence-based reforms and alternative funding solutions before enacting broad reductions.\n- Suggested path forward: Protect or increase strategic investments in education and research while improving accountability, focusing cuts on demonstrably wasteful programs, safeguarding student support, and ensuring long-term national competitiveness and equity.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": 50, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary of comments:\n- Predominant view: Strong opposition to cutting academic funding.
