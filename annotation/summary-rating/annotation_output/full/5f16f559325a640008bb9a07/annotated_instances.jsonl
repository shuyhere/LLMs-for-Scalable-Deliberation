A significant portion of comments express support for accepting refugees fleeing war, persecution, or dangerous situations, often citing humanitarian reasons, empathy, and the belief that all people deserve safety and a good life. These supporters frequently emphasize that refugees are innocent people who did not choose their circumstances.</p>\n<p>However, there is also strong opposition and conditional support voiced by others. Some express concern about the economic impact, arguing that limited resources should first address the needs of existing citizens before accepting refugees. Others call for stricter vetting processes and integration education to ensure national security and social cohesion. A recurring theme among conditional opinions is the need to balance humanitarian obligations with practical considerations about government expenditure and maintaining quality of life for current residents.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation reflects a tension between humanitarian ideals and pragmatic concerns about resources and integration.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 8s "}}
