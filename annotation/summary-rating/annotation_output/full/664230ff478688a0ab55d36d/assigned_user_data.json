A common theme is the perception that rapid updates are driven more by marketing and profit motives than by meaningful innovation.

There is a strong sense that this cycle promotes planned obsolescence, where older devices are either no longer supported or deliberately made less functional, pushing consumers to buy new products.</p>\n<p>Environmental concerns are also frequently mentioned. The rapid turnover of electronic devices contributes to significant electronic waste and resource depletion. Some users criticize the practice of changing charger types and other accessories with each new model, which adds to the environmental burden and consumer costs.
