These supporters emphasized humanitarian and moral obligations, noting that helping those fleeing danger is \"the right thing to do\" and reflects compassion for people in life-threatening situations. Many pointed to America's identity as a nation built by immigrants and refugees, suggesting this heritage creates a responsibility to help others seeking safety. Several respondents also acknowledged America's role in global conflicts, arguing that the U.S. has a particular obligation to help refugees when American foreign policy has contributed to the conditions they're fleeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to accepting refugees</strong> represented about 20% of responses, with concerns primarily focused on domestic priorities. These respondents argued that America should \"take care of our own\" first, citing national debt, struggling citizens, and strained resources. Some expressed frustration that refugees and immigrants receive assistance while American citizens in need are overlooked. A few raised security concerns about inadequate vetting processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional support or neutrality</strong> was expressed by roughly 10% of respondents. These individuals supported refugee acceptance in principle but emphasized the need for thorough vetting, background checks, and limits to prevent strain on resources. Several suggested that support should depend on refugees being genuine war victims rather than economic migrants, and that criminal backgrounds should disqualify applicants.</p>\n<p>Common themes across supportive responses included references to safety, human dignity, and moral responsibility. Many supporters viewed refugee acceptance as both a humanitarian imperative and an opportunity for cultural enrichment and economic growth. Those opposed frequently cited resource scarcity and the need to prioritize existing citizens. Nearly all respondents, regardless of position, emphasized the importance of safety and security in any refugee policy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 31s "}}
