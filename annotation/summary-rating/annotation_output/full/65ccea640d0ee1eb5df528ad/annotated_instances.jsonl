A large majority of users report that it streamlines work and daily routines by automating mundane tasks, accelerating research, and aiding in writing or editing. This has freed up personal time and reduced the mental effort required for various activities. Many also highlight its value as a creative and learning tool, helping with art, idea generation, and skill development.</p>\n<p>However, a significant portion of users express notable concerns. Privacy and data security are frequently cited as major worries, with many feeling that AI's data collection is an intrusion. There is also considerable anxiety regarding job security and the potential for AI to create dependency, diminishing personal skills and original thought. Furthermore, a notable percentage of users report increased distrust in digital content, citing the prevalence of deepfakes, biased information, and a general uncertainty about the authenticity of what they see online.</p>\n<p>Overall, the technology is viewed as a powerful, transformative assistant that offers substantial benefits in convenience and capability, but its adoption is tempered by widespread apprehension about its ethical implications and long-term societal impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 24s "}}
