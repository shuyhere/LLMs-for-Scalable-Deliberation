Approximately 75% of respondents believed tariffs would lead to higher costs for everyday goods, with companies passing tariff expenses directly to consumers. Many participants noted they were already experiencing price increases, particularly affecting small businesses and middle-class households struggling with affordability. Several mentioned specific impacts on their businesses, including difficulties importing supplies and decreased package shipping volumes.</p>\n<p><strong>Short-term vs. Long-term Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>While the majority viewed tariffs negatively, about 20% of participants saw potential long-term benefits. These individuals argued that tariffs could eventually strengthen domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and level the playing field in international trade. Some noted that the U.S. had been disadvantaged by one-sided tariff arrangements and that current policies could generate revenue for the treasury.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Many participants worried about deteriorating relationships with trading partners, particularly Canada and China. They feared retaliatory measures and the isolation of the U.S. from global markets. Some noted that companies were already seeking alternative trading arrangements to avoid U.S. tariffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Critics characterized the tariff approach as poorly planned, unstable, and overly broad rather than strategically targeted. Several participants questioned whether the administration understood how tariffs function, viewing them as taxes ultimately paid by American consumers rather than foreign countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Societal Impact</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond economic effects, participants expressed concerns about increased financial strain on vulnerable populations, potential job losses, and reduced quality of life. Some worried about the combination of tariffs with other policy changes, such as potential cuts to food assistance programs.</p>\n<p>The minority supporting the policies emphasized themes of economic nationalism, suggesting that short-term pain would lead to long-term gains through increased domestic production and fairer international trade relationships. However, the predominant view was that tariffs represented a misguided policy causing immediate harm with uncertain future benefits.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
