The primary reasoning is the protection of public health and the \"greater good\" of the community. Many who hold this view cite the recent COVID-19 pandemic as evidence that such measures are necessary to stop the spread of disease, achieve herd immunity, and prevent individuals from making choices that endanger others. These supporters believe it is the government's duty to protect its citizens, and enforcement is the most effective way to ensure collective safety during a crisis. Some add a condition that this power should only be used when an epidemic is truly severe and the vaccines are proven to be safe and effective.</p>\n<p>A large percentage of respondents are opposed to government enforcement. The core arguments against it are rooted in principles of individual liberty, bodily autonomy, and the right to choose what goes into one's own body. Many in this group express significant distrust in both the government and the safety of rapidly developed vaccines, frequently referencing the COVID-19 vaccines and concerns about side effects or a lack of long-term data. Others feel that mandates are an overreach of government power, ineffective because people will resist, or based on conflicting information that creates public fear.</p>\n<p>A smaller group holds a nuanced position, distinguishing between the two measures. These individuals tend to support the enforcement of quarantine as a temporary public safety measure but are against mandatory vaccination, viewing it as a more permanent and personal medical decision.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 49s "}}
