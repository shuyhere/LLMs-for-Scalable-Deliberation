Some also express worry about strained international relations, reduced global competitiveness, and negative effects on small businesses. Additionally, several comments mention that any potential long-term benefits, such as job creation or economic stabilization, are uncertain or outweighed by immediate drawbacks.</p>\n<p>Among positive perspectives, a minority of comments suggest that tariffs could strengthen the U.S. economy over time by addressing trade imbalances, increasing federal revenues, and encouraging domestic production. These views often highlight a belief in strategic long-term gains despite possible short-term challenges.</p>\n<p>A few comments acknowledge mixed or uncertain effects, noting that outcomes may vary by industry or evolve over time, though these are less common. The prevailing sentiment, however, leans toward apprehension about economic and societal costs.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}
