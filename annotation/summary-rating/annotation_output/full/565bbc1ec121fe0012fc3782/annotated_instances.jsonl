The most common reasons for support are rooted in humanitarianism, empathy, and a sense of moral duty. Many express that offering refuge is the \"right and kind thing to do,\" putting themselves in the refugees' position and recognizing the need for a safe place. Some view it as a core American value, citing the nation's history as a haven for those fleeing persecution. A few commenters also argue that the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees, especially when American foreign policy may have contributed to the conflicts they are fleeing.</p>\n<p>However, a large portion of this support is conditional. The most frequently mentioned condition is the necessity of a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure that individuals with criminal backgrounds or who pose a security risk are not admitted. Other common conditions include setting limits on the number of refugees to avoid straining domestic resources and ensuring that the quality of life for current citizens is not negatively impacted. Some also believe support should be contingent on there being no negative effects on the economy.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of participants voiced opposition to accepting more refugees. Their primary concerns centered on the strain on domestic resources, the economy, and social systems. These commenters argued that the U.S. should prioritize taking care of its own citizens, citing issues like national debt and the needs of everyday Americans. Some feel that the country is already overwhelmed and that refugees are an additional burden on government expenditure. One commenter suggested that refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 25s "}}
