A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current tipping culture for being overly expected or even manipulative, particularly in situations where service is minimal or not directly provided. Many express frustration with the rise of tipping prompts on digital payment systems and the pressure to tip regardless of the service quality.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that tipped workers should be paid a fair, livable wage by their employers, rather than relying on customer generosity. Approximately 60% of the comments suggest that the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with businesses, not consumers. Some propose alternative models, such as a fixed service charge or integrating service costs into the overall price, similar to practices in other countries.</p>\n<p>While a portion of the comments support tipping as a way to reward good service, there is a general consensus that it should be optional and not coerced. Many argue that tipping should only occur when service is clearly provided and appreciated. Others advocate for the complete abolition of the tipping system in favor of a more transparent and equitable wage structure for service workers.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights the need for a more just and voluntary tipping system, with a strong call for higher wages for service workers and less pressure on consumers to tip in every transaction.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 36s "}}
