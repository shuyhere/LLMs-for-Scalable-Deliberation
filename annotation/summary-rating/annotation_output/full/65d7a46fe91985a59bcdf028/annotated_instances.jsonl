Supporters argued that such measures are necessary to <strong>prevent widespread illness and death</strong>, ensure <strong>herd immunity</strong>, and <strong>protect the most vulnerable</strong>. Many referenced the <strong>experience of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> as a justification for proactive government intervention, noting how unvaccinated individuals or resistance to public health measures <strong>slowed recovery and increased risk</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some supporters also acknowledged the <strong>importance of balancing individual rights</strong> with public health needs, suggesting that enforcement should be <strong>proportional to the severity of the epidemic</strong> and based on <strong>proven scientific evidence</strong>. A few noted that <strong>penalties for non-compliance</strong> could be appropriate in extreme cases, though this was less common.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable share of comments <strong>opposed government enforcement</strong>, often citing <strong>concerns about individual autonomy, vaccine safety, and government overreach</strong>. Opponents argued that <strong>mandatory vaccination infringes on personal choice</strong>, and some expressed <strong>distrust in government transparency and decision-making</strong>, particularly in the context of the <strong>rapid development and rollout of vaccines during the pandemic</strong>. A few suggested that <strong>vaccines should be available but not mandatory</strong>, and that <strong>quarantine measures may be acceptable but not vaccination</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some comments also reflected <strong>polarized or ideological views</strong>, with a small number of responses containing <strong>strongly negative or conspiratorial language</strong>, though these were not representative of the broader sentiment.</p>\n<p>In general, the debate centered on the <strong>tension between public health and personal freedom</strong>, with many acknowledging the <strong>complexity of the issue</strong> and the need for <strong>transparent, evidence-based governance</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 50s "}}
