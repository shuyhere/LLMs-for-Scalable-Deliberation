They worry about the intrusiveness of verifying identity and the creation of large personal data databases by tech companies. There is a fear that this data could be misused, sold, or even used by governments to target individuals for their beliefs. Commenters also champion the importance of anonymity as a fundamental freedom online, allowing people to express themselves without fear of personal or professional consequences, such as losing a job over political opinions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the proposal argue that it would increase accountability and improve user behavior. They believe that linking real identities to online accounts would reduce negative activities like cyberbullying and scams, making social media a safer environment.</p>\n<p>Some comments offer a more nuanced perspective. One view suggests that a platform requiring real names might be acceptable, whereas a government mandate would not be. Another perspective acknowledges the merits of accountability while also recognizing the value of anonymous speech as an important freedom that would be lost.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 11s "}}
