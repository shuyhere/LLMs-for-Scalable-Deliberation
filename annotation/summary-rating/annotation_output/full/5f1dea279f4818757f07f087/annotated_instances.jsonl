Many argue that the current private healthcare system is inaccessible, unaffordable, and fails to deliver equitable outcomes. Commenters highlight the success of universal healthcare in other developed nations and express frustration that the U.S. lags behind in this area. Several also connect access to healthcare with broader social and economic stability, noting that a healthy population is essential for national security, workforce productivity, and overall quality of life.</p>\n<p>Supporters often mention the moral obligation of the government to care for its citizens and the inefficiencies and profit-driven nature of private healthcare systems. Many advocate for a public option to coexist with private insurance, emphasizing the importance of choice while ensuring baseline coverage for all. Some express concerns about government inefficiency or oppose government overreach, but these views are less prevalent.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the financial burden of healthcare in the U.S., with commenters noting that high costs can lead to medical debt, prevent people from seeking care, and even result in death due to lack of access. Others emphasize the need for timely and equitable care, particularly for marginalized or low-income populations. A few commenters also express frustration with the current political climate and the prioritization of military spending over domestic social programs.</p>\n<p>In summary, the overwhelming majority of comments support government-provided basic health insurance, framing it as a moral, economic, and social imperative. The discussion centers on the belief that healthcare should not be a privilege, but a right, and that the government has both the responsibility and the means to ensure this right is fulfilled.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 23s "}}
