Participants consistently report feeling pressured by ubiquitous digital payment screens requesting tips for minimal or no service interactions.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns About Current System</h6>\n<p>A significant majority of respondents express frustration with what they perceive as \"tipping creep\" - the expansion of tipping expectations into transactions that previously didn't involve gratuities. Many specifically mention being prompted to tip at counter service establishments, pickup orders, and basic retail transactions. The phrase \"out of control\" appears frequently throughout the responses.</p>\n<p>The pressure created by point-of-sale systems emerges as a particular pain point. Respondents describe feeling uncomfortable declining tips when presented with digital screens, especially when employees are watching. Several mention the awkwardness of navigating multiple screens to select a no-tip option.</p>\n<h6>Wage and Economic Concerns</h6>\n<p>A dominant theme centers on the relationship between tipping and wages. Most participants believe employers use tipping as an excuse to underpay workers, shifting compensation responsibility to customers. Many specifically reference the $2.13 hourly wage for tipped workers, viewing this as exploitative. There's widespread support for establishing living wages that would reduce or eliminate workers' dependence on tips.</p>\n<p>Participants also express concern about the economic burden on both sides - customers feeling financially strained by expanding tip expectations, and workers facing income uncertainty due to variable tips.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion is complete elimination of tipping in favor of fair wages paid directly by employers. Many reference European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices or tipping is minimal.</p>\n<p>Other frequently mentioned improvements include:\n- Making tipping truly optional without pressure\n- Limiting tip requests to full-service situations only\n- Implementing automatic service charges (typically 10%) instead of variable tips\n- Ensuring easy \"no tip\" options on payment screens\n- Allowing tips only after service is rendered and can be evaluated</p>\n<h6>Minority Perspectives</h6>\n<p>While most responses are critical, a smaller portion of participants support tipping when it rewards exceptional service or helps workers earn above minimum wage. Some view generous tipping as a personal responsibility given current wage structures. A few respondents always tip substantially, viewing it as supporting workers in demanding jobs.</p>\n<h6>Cultural and Systemic Issues</h6>\n<p>Many participants frame tipping as a uniquely American problem, noting that most other countries have different compensation models. There's recognition that changing the system would require fundamental shifts in how service industries operate and price their offerings. Several respondents indicate willingness to pay higher base prices if it meant elimination of tipping and fair worker wages.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a system that many view as broken - one that creates discomfort for customers, uncertainty for workers, and allows employers to shift compensation responsibilities. While approaches to reform vary, there's clear consensus that the current tipping culture has become problematic and needs substantial change.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 19s "}}
