The most common concern was the long-term negative impact on the nation's future. Many argued that education is the foundation of society and essential for innovation, economic strength, and global competitiveness. They worried that reducing funds would stifle critical research, particularly in science and medicine, and lead to a \"brain drain\" as talented researchers and academics leave the country for better opportunities.</p>\n<p>Another significant theme was the direct harm to students and educators. Participants noted that the cuts would limit opportunities, especially for students from low-income backgrounds, making higher education less accessible and potentially increasing student debt. They also pointed to the negative effects on the quality of education, from K-12 to universities, citing the potential for larger class sizes and fewer resources.</p>\n<p>Several comments attributed the cuts to a political motive, suggesting it was a tactic to control an uneducated populace, punish institutions with opposing viewpoints, or force people into low-paying jobs. These participants often used strong language, describing the decision as \"idiotic,\" \"horrible,\" and a classic authoritarian strategy.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a smaller portion of participants supported the cuts or saw some justification for them. The primary reason for their support was the belief that academic institutions promote \"left-leaning\" or \"marxist\" ideologies and \"DEI programs\" that are detrimental to the country. Some also felt that universities are financially wasteful or that government subsidies have inflated costs, making cuts a necessary corrective measure. A few expressed trust that there were good reasons for the decision, even if they were not fully apparent.</p>\n<p>A few participants held a more nuanced view, acknowledging the need to cut wasteful spending but expressing concern that broad cuts would harm essential research and student opportunities. They called for a more balanced approach that invests in the future while ensuring financial responsibility. A small number of individuals stated they did not have enough information to form an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 14s "}}
