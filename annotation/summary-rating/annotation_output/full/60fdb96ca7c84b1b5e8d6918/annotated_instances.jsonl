Many commenters argue that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, inflation, and reduced economic stability, particularly for middle-class and low-income households. Some highlight the potential for trade retaliation, strained international relations, and long-term economic uncertainty, especially if global supply chains are disrupted or if the U.S. becomes isolated in trade negotiations.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments emphasize that while certain industries or businesses may benefit in the short term, the broader economy and general population are likely to bear the costs. Additionally, several commenters express skepticism about the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving their stated goals, such as bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., noting that supply chains are complex and difficult to reverse quickly.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller share of the comments suggest that the tariff policy could have a positive long-term impact, particularly if it helps reduce trade deficits, stabilize the economy, or encourage domestic production. Some argue that the policy reflects a necessary shift toward protecting U.S. interests and promoting economic independence, especially after years of perceived imbalances in international trade.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that the policy is driven by political motivations rather than sound economic strategy, with some commenters suggesting that it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals or corporations while harming small businesses and everyday consumers. Others note that while there may be initial disruptions, the policy could ultimately lead to economic growth and greater self-sufficiency over time.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments indicate a general concern about the short-term economic effects of the tariff policy, with a more divided view on its long-term implications. Many emphasize the need for a balanced and strategic approach to trade policy that considers both economic and diplomatic consequences.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
