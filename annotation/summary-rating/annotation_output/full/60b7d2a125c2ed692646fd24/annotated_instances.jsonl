A significant portion of comments advocate for robust vetting processes to ensure security and manage risks, while others express concerns about economic impacts, resource allocation, and prioritizing the needs of current citizens. Some comments highlight the importance of cultural diversity, historical context, and global solidarity as reasons for support, whereas a smaller share opposes or expresses hesitation due to fears of overburdening systems, insufficient vetting, or domestic challenges.
