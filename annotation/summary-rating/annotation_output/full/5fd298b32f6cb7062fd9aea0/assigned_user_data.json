A majority of the comments express strong support for government-provided healthcare, often grounded in the belief that access to healthcare is a fundamental human right. Supporters argue that healthcare should not be a privilege tied to income, employment, or wealth, and that a government-run system would ensure equitable access, reduce medical debt, and improve public health outcomes.

Some emphasize the economic benefits of a healthier population, including reduced long-term healthcare costs and improved productivity.</p>\n<p>While the majority support government involvement, a smaller but notable portion of comments express reservations or opposition. Opponents argue that government-run healthcare could lead to inefficiencies, longer wait times, and reduced quality of care.
