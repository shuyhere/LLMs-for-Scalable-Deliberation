This support is primarily rooted in the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many argue that no one should suffer, face bankruptcy, or die because they cannot afford medical care.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the critique of the current healthcare system in the United States. Commenters describe it as prohibitively expensive, inaccessible, and inefficient, with poor outcomes compared to the high costs. Several people point out that most other developed nations have universal healthcare systems, suggesting the U.S. is lagging behind. The profit motive of private insurance companies is frequently cited as a core problem, with the belief that a government-run system could prioritize public good over profit.</p>\n<p>Economic and public health arguments are also prominent. Supporters believe a universal system would lead to a healthier, more productive workforce, reduce medical debt, and stimulate the economy. Furthermore, it would encourage preventative care, allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, which is seen as more effective and less costly in the long run.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, some commenters offer nuanced or conditional approval. A notable portion of these participants advocate for a public option that would exist alongside private insurance, preserving consumer choice. Others express support on the condition that the system is efficient and that care is administered in a timely manner. A few draw a line between providing \"basic\" care, which they support, and \"extensive\" care, which they view with more skepticism.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments express opposition to a government-provided system. The primary arguments against it include the belief that government is inherently inefficient and would lead to a lower quality of care, longer wait times, and wasteful spending. These commenters argue that healthcare is better managed by the private sector and express concerns about the high cost to taxpayers and an increase in dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}
