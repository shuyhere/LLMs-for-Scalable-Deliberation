Many argue that tipping should be voluntary and based on the quality of service, rather than being a default or mandatory expectation. A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current system for placing undue financial and social pressure on customers and for allowing employers to pay their workers below a living wage. Several commenters suggest that tipping should be eliminated in favor of fair base wages for service workers, drawing comparisons to practices in other countries where tips are less common or not expected.</p>\n<p>Some propose structural changes, such as standardizing tip amounts, removing tipping from digital payment interfaces unless clearly warranted by service, or incorporating a service charge into the bill. Others suggest that if tipping is to remain, it should be a gesture of gratitude rather than an obligation, with rewards or recognition for the worker as a way to encourage it without pressure.</p>\n<p>There is also recognition that tipping can be a positive practice when it reflects appreciation for good service, but it is seen as problematic when it becomes a norm for even minimal or no service. Overall, the sentiment leans toward reforming or eliminating the tipping system in favor of a more equitable and transparent model of compensation for service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
