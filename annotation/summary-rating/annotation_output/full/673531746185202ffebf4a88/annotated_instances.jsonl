About two-thirds support government-enforced quarantine, while views on vaccine mandates are more divided.</li>\n<li>Support for enforcement:</li>\n<li>Around 67% favor the government having authority to enforce quarantine.</li>\n<li>About 53% support vaccine mandates, and roughly 50% support enforcing both vaccination and quarantine.</li>\n<li>Common reasons: protecting public health and the vulnerable, achieving herd immunity, reducing spread and deaths, and ending crises faster. Many cite science- and evidence-based decision-making and the \u201cgreater good.\u201d</li>\n<li>Conditional support is common: Support often depends on the severity of the epidemic, vaccines being thoroughly tested/FDA-approved and proven effective, clear and transparent communication, time-limited measures, medical exemptions, and making vaccines free to avoid inequities.</li>\n<li>Partial support:</li>\n<li>About 11% back quarantine mandates but oppose vaccine mandates, often citing bodily autonomy for vaccination while accepting quarantine to protect others.</li>\n<li>Opposition:</li>\n<li>Roughly 19% oppose any government enforcement of vaccination or quarantine.</li>\n<li>Common reasons: bodily autonomy and constitutional/liberty concerns, distrust of government due to perceived mishandling or lack of transparency, and worries about rapid vaccine development, side effects, and insufficient long-term data. Some mention job loss and coercion during COVID as cautionary examples.</li>\n<li>Enforcement approaches and alternatives:</li>\n<li>A minority call for strong penalties for noncompliance (e.g., fines, work restrictions), whereas others prefer education, voluntary uptake, and strong encouragement over mandates.</li>\n<li>Tone and references:</li>\n<li>Many comments reference COVID-19 experiences\u2014some as justification for decisive government action, others as evidence against mandates.
