The most commonly cited negative effects include <strong>rising prices, economic instability, and harm to small businesses and consumers</strong>. While a smaller group believes the policy could be beneficial in the long run or is a necessary step for economic fairness, the <strong>majority of perspectives express concern</strong> about the broader consequences of the policy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>The comments provided reflect a diverse range of perspectives on the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policy on the U.S. economy and society. The majority of the comments express a <strong>negative impact</strong>, with concerns centered on increased consumer prices, inflation, reduced consumer spending, and harm to small businesses. Many respondents argue that the burden of tariffs is ultimately passed on to U.S. consumers, making everyday goods more expensive and exacerbating economic hardship for middle- and lower-income individuals.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback highlights <strong>negative effects on international trade relationships</strong>, with concerns that the U.S. is being portrayed as an aggressive or unfair trading partner. This has led to retaliatory measures from other countries, trade disruptions, and a loss of American soft power. Some commenters also express doubt about the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving long-term economic goals, noting that reshoring industries is difficult and that global supply chains are not easily reversed.</p>\n<p>A smaller but notable group of respondents believe the policy will have a <strong>positive or mixed impact</strong>. These individuals argue that tariffs help level the playing field by bringing in much-needed revenue, encouraging domestic production, and protecting certain U.S. industries. Some believe that, although the short-term effects may be painful, the long-term benefits\u2014such as reduced trade deficits and revitalized manufacturing\u2014could be significant.</p>\n<p>A few comments emphasize that the impact is <strong>mixed</strong>, acknowledging potential benefits for certain sectors while recognizing the broader economic and social costs. These perspectives often highlight the complexity of trade policy, noting that while some industries may benefit, others suffer, and the overall effects on the economy and society remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>In summary, the sentiment among the commenters leans heavily toward <strong>negative</strong>, with concerns about inflation, consumer harm, and international trade tensions being the most frequently cited. While some see long-term benefits or a balanced outcome, the prevailing view is that the current tariff policy is causing more harm than good for the U.S. economy and society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
