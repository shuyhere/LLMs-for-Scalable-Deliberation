Overall, the majority of respondents view AI as a tool that has enhanced productivity, streamlined tasks, and improved access to information. Approximately 65% of the comments highlight AI's positive impact, particularly in making work and daily routines more efficient, aiding in research, and supporting creativity. Many users appreciate AI's ability to assist with writing, summarizing, and generating ideas, with some describing it as an indispensable assistant.</p>\n<p>At the same time, a significant portion of the feedback expresses concerns about privacy, job security, and the authenticity of content. Around 30% of the comments reflect anxieties about AI\u2019s potential to erode personal privacy, replace human labor, or contribute to the spread of misinformation and deepfakes. Some individuals also noted a growing distrust in online content and a fear of becoming overly reliant on AI for critical thinking.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset of comments (about 15%) indicated that AI has not significantly changed their lives or that they use it only minimally. A few users expressed frustration or dissatisfaction, feeling that AI has made life more complex or that it is overused in areas like art and social media.</p>\n<p>In summary, AI is widely seen as a transformative tool that enhances productivity and creativity while also raising important ethical and societal questions. Many users appreciate its utility, but concerns about privacy, job displacement, and the authenticity of AI-generated content remain prevalent.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}
