A common complaint was that tipping prompts now appear for basic transactions that previously didn't involve tips, creating pressure and \"bullying\" customers into tipping. Several people noted that what should be simple transactions have become complicated by mandatory tipping menus.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform as Primary Solution</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocated for systemic change rather than tweaking the tipping system itself. The most frequently suggested improvement was ensuring all workers receive livable base wages, eliminating their dependence on tips for survival. Many felt the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with employers, not customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Preferences for Voluntary vs. Mandatory Tipping</strong>\nThere was strong support for making tipping purely voluntary and merit-based. Respondents wanted tipping to return to its original purpose - rewarding quality service - rather than being an expected or forced component of every transaction. Several specifically opposed mandatory tipping policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Approaches</strong>\nSome creative suggestions emerged for reimagining the tipping system:\n- Providing tangible rewards to tippers (thank you notes, coupons for future visits)\n- Shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping\n- Standardizing higher tip amounts (e.g., $20-30) regardless of bill size</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Elimination</strong>\nA notable minority favored abolishing the tipping system entirely, viewing it as fundamentally flawed and preferring a straightforward pricing model where service costs are built into listed prices.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect widespread dissatisfaction with current tipping practices, with most respondents seeking either significant reform or complete elimination of the system in favor of fair wages and transparent pricing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 35s "}}
