The proliferation of tablet point-of-sale systems is frequently cited as a source of pressure and discomfort for customers.</p>\n<p>A significant majority of commenters identified the root of the problem as employers failing to pay their employees a livable wage. The current system is largely viewed as a way for businesses to subsidize their labor costs by shifting the responsibility of employee compensation onto the customer.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the most frequently proposed solution is to eliminate the reliance on tips by requiring employers to pay a fair, livable wage. This would transform tipping from an obligation into a truly voluntary reward for exceptional service. Many expressed a willingness to pay higher prices for goods and services if they knew the increase went directly to ensuring fair employee pay. Other suggested alternatives include adopting a European or Japanese model where a service charge is automatically included in the bill, making the system more predictable for both workers and consumers.</p>\n<p>While critical of the system, many commenters expressed empathy for service workers and continue to tip, often generously, out of a sense of duty. However, there is a clear consensus that tipping should be earned based on the quality of service provided, a principle many feel is being lost in the current culture of obligatory tipping.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}
