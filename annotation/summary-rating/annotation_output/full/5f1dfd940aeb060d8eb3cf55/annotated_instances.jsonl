They see it as a legitimate and innovative way for people to earn a living, often by pursuing their passions and connecting with audiences in a way traditional jobs cannot. Influencers are described as the \"new media,\" providing valuable entertainment, information, advice, and product recommendations. Many appreciate that this career path democratizes fame and entrepreneurship, allowing everyday people to build a platform and a business.</p>\n<p>However, there are also strong reservations and criticisms. A frequently mentioned concern is the lack of authenticity, with many perceiving influencers as disingenuous or \"fake.\" Critics also worry about the negative societal impact, such as the promotion of overconsumption, the creation of a herd mentality that stifles individuality, and the risk of spreading misinformation. Some express concern that influencing gives younger generations unrealistic ideas about success, potentially devaluing traditional education and careers. The field is also described as oversaturated, which can lead to a decline in content quality and a need for creators to be outrageous to stand out.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme across both positive and negative viewpoints is the need for responsibility and accountability. Many commenters believe that because of their significant impact, influencers should be held to professional standards and be mindful of their audience.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}
