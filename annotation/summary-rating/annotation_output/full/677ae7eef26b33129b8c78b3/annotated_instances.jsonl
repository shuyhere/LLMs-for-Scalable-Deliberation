Several pointed to the recent pandemic as evidence that such measures are needed to help society return to normal. One view suggested that enforcement is especially critical in the early stages of a health crisis when information is limited.</p>\n<p>Those who oppose enforcement raised concerns centered on individual liberty, effectiveness, and safety. Some believe people should be encouraged rather than forced, respecting different personal beliefs. Another commenter felt that mandates are pointless because people will ultimately do what they want. Health concerns were also cited, specifically regarding the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccines and potential side effects.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
