Concerns about <strong>overburdening public resources, economic strain, and competition for services</strong> were frequently mentioned, particularly by those who expressed <strong>opposition or hesitation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some <strong>opposition</strong> was based on the belief that the U.S. should <strong>prioritize its own citizens</strong> and address domestic issues before accepting more refugees. Others raised concerns about <strong>abuse of the system</strong>, <strong>increased crime</strong>, and <strong>cultural tensions</strong>. A smaller group of commenters were <strong>neutral or conflicted</strong>, acknowledging the plight of refugees while expressing uncertainty about the practical implications of increased acceptance.</p>\n<p>A <strong>few commenters opposed the idea outright</strong>, citing <strong>national decline, resource scarcity, and a belief that refugees should seek refuge in neighboring countries</strong>.
