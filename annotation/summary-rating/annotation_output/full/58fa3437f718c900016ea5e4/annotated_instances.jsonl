They view healthcare as a fundamental human right that should not be dependent on income or employment status. A recurring theme is the belief that the government has a duty to care for its citizens' well-being and that the current for-profit system is failing, resulting in prohibitive costs, limited access, and poor outcomes for many.</p>\n<p>Many supporters point to the successful implementation of universal healthcare in other developed nations as a model the US should follow. They argue that a government system would be more equitable, efficient, and would alleviate the burden of medical debt and the fear of being unable to afford care.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of comments express opposition or reservations, citing concerns about government inefficiency, a desire for private options to remain available, and a belief that dependency on government should be reduced. Among supporters, some stipulate that care must be administered in a timely manner for them to fully endorse a government system.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment strongly favors a shift toward a government-provided or government-backed universal healthcare system, framed as a moral imperative, an economic necessity, and a matter of national competitiveness.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 57s "}}
