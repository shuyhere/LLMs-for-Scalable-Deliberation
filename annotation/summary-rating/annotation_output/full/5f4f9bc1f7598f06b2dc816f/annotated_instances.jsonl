Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping by modern point-of-sale tablets that often default to a tip screen, making it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<p>The most prevalent theme is that the tipping system allows employers to underpay their staff, shifting the responsibility of providing a livable wage from the business to the consumer. Consequently, the most frequently proposed solution is to eliminate the current tipping system entirely. In its place, many advocate for businesses to be required to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, even if that means higher prices for goods and services.</p>\n<p>While the desire to abolish the system is strong, many still believe in tipping as a voluntary reward for exceptional service. The core principle for this group is that tips should be earned based on the quality of service provided, not be an obligation or an expectation for every transaction.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions for reform include replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge, changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts, and making the \"no tip\" option on payment systems more accessible. Overall, while some see tipping as a beneficial way to show appreciation, the prevailing sentiment is that the system is fundamentally flawed, creating pressure on customers and failing to provide stable, fair compensation for workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}
