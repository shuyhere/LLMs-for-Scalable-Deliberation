Overall, a majority of the comments express support for accepting refugees, often grounded in moral, humanitarian, or ethical principles. Supporters emphasize the importance of compassion, the U.S.\u2019s historical role as a refuge for those fleeing persecution, and the responsibility of a wealthy and powerful nation to assist those in need.

These include calls for thorough vetting processes, ensuring that refugees do not pose security risks, and limiting numbers to avoid straining public resources or displacing the needs of current citizens. Some express concern about the current state of the U.S. economy, national debt, or domestic social issues, arguing that the country should focus on its own citizens first.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller but vocal minority oppose accepting more refugees. Their concerns are often tied to economic strain, overpopulation, and the belief that the U.S. is not in a position to take in more people. Some also express frustration with existing immigration systems, citing inefficiencies, fraud, or the perception that undocumented immigrants receive more support than native-born citizens. A few commenters argue that refugees should seek help in neighboring countries rather than coming to the U.S.</p>\n<p>There is also a notable presence of nuanced or conflicted viewpoints.
