Supporters view enforcement as the most effective way to protect public health and curb disease spread, often referencing lessons from the recent pandemic. Several emphasize conditions: measures should be evidence-based, focused on well-tested vaccines, and potentially time-limited or adjustable as knowledge and risk levels evolve. They also argue that mandates can be necessary when individual choices endanger the broader community. Opponents stress personal freedom and respect for differing beliefs, question whether enforcement is practical or effective, and raise concerns about the rapid development and perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines. A recurring middle-ground theme is preference for strong encouragement and education, with enforcement reserved for high-risk phases or clearly justified circumstances.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}
