Many participants emphasized that anonymity is essential for individuals in vulnerable situations, such as those experiencing domestic abuse or those with controversial political views.

Supporters believed that real-name policies could improve the overall quality of online discourse and help distinguish between genuine users and bots or malicious actors.</p>\n<p>Some respondents took a <strong>neutral or conditional stance</strong>, suggesting that real-name requirements could be acceptable if implemented carefully and with safeguards, such as allowing pseudonyms for personal use while ensuring real identities are on file for verification purposes.
