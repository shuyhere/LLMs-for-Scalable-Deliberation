A significant percentage of participants believe the fundamental solution is to abolish tipping entirely and require employers to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, even if it means higher menu prices.</p>\n<p>Another major theme is \"tipping fatigue,\" driven by the expansion of tipping requests to nearly every transaction, including counter service, pickup orders, and situations with minimal or no direct service. Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" by tablet point-of-sale systems that often default to tip options and make it awkward to decline.</p>\n<p>There is a strong consensus that tips should be a voluntary reward for excellent service, not a mandatory or expected charge. Many feel the system has lost its original purpose, with people feeling obligated to tip for even subpar service.</p>\n<p>While the desire to abolish the system is the most common suggestion, other proposed improvements include:\n*   Adopting systems used in other countries, such as a built-in service charge.\n*   Limiting tipping requests to only full-service environments like sit-down restaurants.\n*   Making the \"no tip\" option on payment screens more accessible and less intrusive.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of participants expressed support for tipping, viewing it as a necessary way to supplement workers' low incomes, a good deed, or a great incentive for employees to provide excellent service. Some of these individuals believe the problem is not the system itself but customers who do not tip appropriately.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 43s "}}
