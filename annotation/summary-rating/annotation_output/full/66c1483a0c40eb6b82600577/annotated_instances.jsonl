Most describe clear productivity gains\u2014automating routine tasks, speeding up research, summarizing information, and freeing personal time\u2014often with perceived improvements in precision and reduced work strain. Many also credit AI with enhancing learning and idea generation, likening it to a more focused, earlier-era search experience. Some highlight personal benefits beyond work, including entertainment and help with emotional perspective during conflicts. Balanced against these upsides are cautions about accuracy, relevance, and source bias, prompting consistent fact-checking.
