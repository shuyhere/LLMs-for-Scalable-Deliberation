Overall, the sentiment leans more toward a negative impact, with several key themes emerging from the discussion.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments highlight concerns about <strong>increased prices for consumers</strong> and the <strong>burden of tariffs being passed down to everyday Americans</strong>. Many argue that while tariffs may generate short-term revenue or protect certain industries, the long-term effects include <strong>rising inflation</strong>, <strong>reduced consumer spending</strong>, and <strong>economic hardship for middle- and lower-income households</strong>. There is also a common concern that tariffs are not effectively <strong>bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</strong>, as companies often absorb or pass on the costs rather than reshore operations.</p>\n<p>Another recurring theme is the <strong>impact on international trade relationships</strong>. Many commenters express worry that the aggressive and unilateral nature of the tariff policy is <strong>damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable trade partner</strong> and may provoke retaliatory measures from other countries. This could lead to <strong>trade wars</strong>, <strong>disrupted global supply chains</strong>, and <strong>reduced economic cooperation</strong> on a global scale.</p>\n<p>Some contributors acknowledge <strong>mixed or long-term benefits</strong>, suggesting that the policy could eventually <strong>stabilize the economy</strong>, <strong>reduce trade deficits</strong>, or <strong>encourage domestic production</strong>. A few also point to <strong>positive outcomes such as increased tax revenue</strong> or <strong>greater awareness of unfair trade practices</strong> by other nations. However, these optimistic views are often tempered by the belief that <strong>any benefits will be slow to materialize</strong> and may not outweigh the immediate costs.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters also emphasize the <strong>negative effects on small businesses</strong>, which are often <strong>disproportionately impacted</strong> by the uncertainty and increased costs associated with tariffs. Some note that <strong>companies are finding ways to work around the tariffs</strong>, which limits their intended economic impact.</p>\n<p>In summary, while a minority of comments express a positive outlook\u2014often tied to long-term goals or the belief that the U.S. has been historically disadvantaged in trade\u2014<strong>the majority of the feedback reflects a negative or mixed assessment</strong>. Concerns about <strong>consumer costs, inflation, international relations, and the effectiveness of the policy</strong> dominate the discussion, with many concluding that the current tariff policy is more harmful than beneficial to the U.S. economy and society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 13s "}}
