A strong majority of commentators express frustration with the expansion of tipping expectations to nearly every transaction, particularly in contexts like counter-service or pickup orders where no traditional service is provided. This is frequently described as creating social pressure and discomfort for customers.</p>\n<p>There is overwhelming support for the idea that employers should pay a living wage to service workers, eliminating their reliance on tips for basic subsistence. Many commentators specifically reference the subminimum wage for tipped workers as a core issue that needs to be addressed. This perspective often comes with the suggestion that tipping should then become a truly voluntary gesture for exceptional service, rather than a mandatory subsidy for low wages.</p>\n<p>Opinions are divided on what should replace the current system. A significant portion of commentators favor completely abolishing tipping and replacing it with higher, all-inclusive prices. Others suggest implementing a standardized, mandatory service charge that would be distributed to staff, a model noted as common in other countries. There is also a desire for less intrusive point-of-sale systems that make selecting \"no tip\" a clear and easy option without social friction.</p>\n<p>A smaller, though still present, percentage of comments support the concept of tipping but believe it should be reserved for specific, service-oriented roles like sit-down restaurant servers. Within this group, there is a preference for tipping to remain a reward for good service that is determined solely by the customer's discretion, not by suggested percentages or social pressure.</p>\n<p>In summary, the collective feedback indicates a tipping culture that is perceived as out of control, with a primary desire to shift the responsibility of fair compensation from the customer to the employer, thereby making any gratuity a genuine bonus rather than an obligation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 25s "}}
