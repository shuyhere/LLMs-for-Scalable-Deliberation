Many believe the system has become overly pervasive, with a large percentage of participants frustrated by being prompted for tips at establishments where they feel no service warranting a tip was provided, such as counter-service or pickup orders. This is frequently described as creating pressure and discomfort for the customer.</p>\n<p>A strong and recurring theme is the belief that employers should be responsible for paying a living wage, thereby eliminating the need for workers to rely on tips for their basic income. Many commenters view the current system as a way for businesses to subsidize labor costs onto the customer. There is a notable sentiment favoring a model similar to those in some European countries, where higher base wages are standard and tipping is less frequent or optional.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the act of tipping itself are mixed. A portion of commenters support tipping for good service in traditional, full-service settings like restaurants but are opposed to its expansion into other transactions. Others maintain that tipping is a positive incentive for excellent service. However, even among those who support the concept, there is widespread agreement that it should be genuinely optional and based solely on the quality of service received, not an expectation to cover low wages.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improvement include replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge, making \"no tip\" options more accessible on point-of-sale systems, and ensuring tips are only solicited after a service has been completed and evaluated. A small minority of comments fully endorse the current system, citing the potential for workers to earn more and the value of rewarding good service, but this perspective is less common. Overall, the collective opinion leans heavily toward systemic change that shifts the responsibility of fair compensation from the consumer to the employer.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 48s "}}
