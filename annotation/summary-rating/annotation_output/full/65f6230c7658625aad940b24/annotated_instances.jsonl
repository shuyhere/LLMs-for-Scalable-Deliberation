The primary reason cited was the protection of public health and the prevention of widespread disease. Several supporters referenced the recent COVID-19 pandemic, arguing that such measures are essential for the \"greater good,\" helping society function and protecting people from the poor decisions of others. One view specified that enforcement was particularly important in the early stages of a pandemic when a virus is not yet well understood.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of comments opposed these mandates. The reasons for this opposition included the belief that enforcement infringes on personal beliefs and individual freedom. Concerns were also raised about vaccine safety, specifically mentioning that the COVID-19 vaccines were not studied for a sufficient length of time before being administered. Finally, one commenter expressed a practical objection, stating that mandates are pointless because people will ultimately do as they please.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
