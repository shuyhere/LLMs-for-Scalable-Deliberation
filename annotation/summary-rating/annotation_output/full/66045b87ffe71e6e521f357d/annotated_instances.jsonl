The most frequently proposed solution is to eliminate the tipping system entirely and require businesses to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, similar to models used in Europe and other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Many express frustration with \"tipping creep,\" where requests for tips have expanded beyond traditional sit-down restaurant service to counter service, pickup orders, and nearly every point-of-sale transaction, often facilitated by tablet payment systems. This has created a sense of pressure and obligation, making it uncomfortable for customers to decline a tip even when little to no service was provided.</p>\n<p>While the desire to abolish the system is a dominant theme, there is also a strong belief that if tipping is to exist, it should return to its original purpose: a voluntary and optional reward for exceptional service, not an expected subsidy for wages. Some suggest alternative systems, such as a mandatory service charge included in the bill, to create more predictability for both workers and customers.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments express support for tipping, viewing it as a necessary way to support underpaid workers, a good deed, or an effective incentive for employees to provide excellent service. However, even among those who currently tip generously, many do so out of a sense of obligation due to the low wages of service workers, while still wishing the system itself would change.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
