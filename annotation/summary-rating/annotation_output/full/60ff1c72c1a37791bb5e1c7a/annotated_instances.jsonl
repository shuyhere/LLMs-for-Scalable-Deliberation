Many believe that companies will pass the cost of tariffs directly to customers, leading to higher prices for everyday goods, increased inflation, and reduced spending power, which disproportionately affects middle and lower-income households. Several participants, including small business owners, noted the direct harm to their operations due to the rising cost of imported materials and products. Others argued that the policy damages international relations, isolates the U.S., invites retaliatory tariffs, and creates economic uncertainty that discourages investment.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of respondents believes the tariff policy will have a positive impact. Their arguments often focus on long-term benefits, suggesting that any current negative effects are temporary. These supporters view the tariffs as a necessary measure to level the global playing field, correct unfair trade practices by other countries, and protect American industries and jobs. Some expressed confidence in the administration's business strategy, believing it will ultimately strengthen the economy and bring revenue to the U.S. treasury.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more mixed assessment, acknowledging that while tariffs might protect certain domestic industries, they also risk raising costs for businesses and consumers. One participant suggested the policy was having little effect, as companies were finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 57s "}}
