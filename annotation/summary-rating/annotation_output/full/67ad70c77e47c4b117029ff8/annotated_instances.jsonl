A significant portion of the feedback highlights that tariffs lead to increased consumer prices, reduced purchasing power, and potential long-term economic instability. Many argue that while certain domestic industries may benefit, the broader economy and everyday citizens, particularly the middle class, are likely to bear the costs through higher living expenses and reduced economic growth.</p>\n<p>Some commenters acknowledge potential long-term benefits, such as stabilizing the economy, increasing federal revenue, or encouraging domestic production, but these views are often tempered by the belief that such benefits are uncertain or outweighed by immediate drawbacks. There is also concern about the geopolitical implications, including strained international trade relationships and a diminished reputation as a reliable trading partner.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the criticism of the policy's implementation, with several commenters suggesting that the approach is inconsistent, poorly targeted, or overly aggressive, leading to confusion among businesses and limited effectiveness in achieving stated goals like job creation or industrial reshoring.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback suggests that the tariff policy is perceived by many as having a negative impact on the U.S. economy and society, primarily due to rising costs for consumers, economic uncertainty, and potential long-term harm to global trade relations. While some anticipate long-term benefits, these are often viewed as speculative or insufficient to offset the current and near-term challenges.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
