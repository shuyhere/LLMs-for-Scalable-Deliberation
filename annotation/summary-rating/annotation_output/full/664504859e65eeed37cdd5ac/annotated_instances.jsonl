Roughly 80\u201385% express support, with many emphasizing compassion, human rights, and providing safety to families.

Common stipulations include:\n- Rigorous vetting and background checks\n- Excluding criminals and economic migrants\n- Setting limits/quotas and balancing resources so citizens\u2019 needs are met\n- Monitoring economic impacts and avoiding strain on social services\n- Providing integration supports, such as cultural orientation, education, and skills training\n- Considering geographic dispersion (e.g., settlement in rural areas or temporary camps)</p>\n<p>Opposition (about 15\u201320%) centers on prioritizing domestic needs first, concerns about debt and resource strain, crowding, and a belief that refugees should seek asylum in neighboring countries; some would accept only in extreme cases.</p>\n<p>A small share is undecided or conflicted, supporting the humanitarian goal but insisting on strong vetting and safeguards. Common ground across views includes the need for thorough screening and policies that protect public safety and avoid overburdening communities.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
