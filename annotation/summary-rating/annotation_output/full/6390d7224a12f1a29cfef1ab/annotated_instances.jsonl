The predominant concern is that this action will undermine the foundation of society by limiting opportunities for students, stifling innovation, and weakening America's long-term global competitiveness. Many commenters describe the cuts as short-sighted and dangerous, arguing they will harm public schools, increase social inequality, and drive talented researchers to other countries. A common theme is that education is a public good essential for a functioning democracy and a strong economy, and defunding it is characterized as an authoritarian tactic to create a less informed populace.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments express support for the funding cuts. This perspective is primarily based on a belief that academic institutions are inefficient, overly politicized, or are indoctrinating students with certain ideologies. These commentators argue that cutting funding could force a necessary overhaul of the education system and that administration should be handled more at the state and local level.</p>\n<p>A very small number of comments are neutral, stating they lack sufficient information to form an opinion or express a hope that the cuts might lead to positive, though unspecified, changes.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 33s "}}
