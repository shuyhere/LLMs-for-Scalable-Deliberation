Many participants emphasized that anonymity is essential for individuals in vulnerable situations, such as those experiencing domestic abuse or those with controversial political views. Others raised concerns about <strong>data security</strong>, noting the risks of identity theft and misuse of personal information by social media companies or governments. Some also pointed out that anonymity allows for open and honest discussions without fear of real-world consequences.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a notable number of participants <strong>supported the idea</strong>, arguing that it would increase <strong>accountability</strong>, reduce <strong>cyberbullying</strong>, and help <strong>combat impersonation and scams</strong>. Supporters believed that real-name policies could improve the overall quality of online discourse and help distinguish between genuine users and bots or malicious actors.</p>\n<p>Some respondents took a <strong>neutral or conditional stance</strong>, suggesting that real-name requirements could be acceptable if implemented carefully and with safeguards, such as allowing pseudonyms for personal use while ensuring real identities are on file for verification purposes. Others proposed <strong>alternative solutions</strong>, such as verified accounts with a symbol (e.g., a checkmark) to distinguish real identities without forcing all users to disclose them.</p>\n<p>In general, the discussion highlighted a <strong>tension between accountability and privacy</strong>, with many acknowledging the potential benefits of real-name policies while expressing reservations about their risks and ethical implications.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
