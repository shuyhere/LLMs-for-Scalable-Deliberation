A majority express frustration with the expectation of tipping across numerous service contexts, particularly when minimal or no service is provided.

Some support tipping as a voluntary reward for exceptional service, while others prefer standardized service charges or fixed amounts instead of percentages. A small percentage view tipping positively as a gesture of appreciation but believe it should remain optional. Concerns are also raised about the financial burden on consumers and the inconsistency in tipping practices.</p>\n<p>Several comments suggest learning from models in other countries where tipping is less prevalent.
