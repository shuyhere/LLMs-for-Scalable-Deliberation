These supporters emphasize empathy, noting they would want safety if in similar circumstances. They highlight that refugees are innocent people, including families with children, who didn't choose their circumstances and deserve compassion. Some supporters view refugee acceptance as a moral obligation, especially when resources are available, arguing that kindness and the opportunity for a good life should be extended regardless of birthplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional support</strong> is voiced by several respondents who believe refugees should be accepted but with specific qualifications. These individuals emphasize the need for thorough vetting processes, clear definitions of what constitutes legitimate refugee status, and limits to prevent negative impacts on citizens' quality of life. Some suggest refugees should receive education about American society and rules to facilitate better integration.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to accepting more refugees</strong> stems primarily from economic and resource allocation concerns. These respondents argue that America cannot afford to accept refugees while facing its own debt and struggling to help existing citizens. They express frustration that resources go to refugees while American citizens are denied assistance, viewing this as unfair. Some worry about long-term impacts, suggesting refugee populations grow over time and strain government resources and social systems.</p>\n<p>The comments reveal a fundamental tension between humanitarian impulses and concerns about domestic priorities, with respondents weighing moral obligations against practical considerations of resource limitations and impacts on current citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 0s "}}
