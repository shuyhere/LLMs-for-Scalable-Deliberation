A significant majority of comments focused on the direct financial burden to American consumers, repeatedly stating that companies will pass the cost of tariffs on to customers, leading to higher prices, increased cost of living, and inflation. This, some argued, would reduce consumer spending and could lead to a recession.</p>\n<p>Further negative arguments included damage to international relations, particularly with China, and the risk of isolating the U.S. from global trade. Several participants expressed concern for small businesses, stating they would be disproportionately harmed. There was also skepticism that the policy would achieve its goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., with some suggesting that companies would rather wait out the policy than invest in reshoring operations. The policy was described by some as poorly conceived, erratic, and a tool that benefits only the wealthy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of participants believe the policy will have a positive impact, primarily in the long term. These commenters argued that the tariffs are a necessary measure to correct unfair trade practices where other countries were taking advantage of the U.S. The belief is that this policy will help stabilize the economy, generate revenue, and encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, making U.S. products more competitive. Some expressed that while there might be negative effects in the short term, the long-term benefits for the economy and for lifting Americans out of poverty would be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>A few comments presented a mixed or neutral view. One perspective was that the policy's effects are mixed, protecting some domestic industries while hurting consumers and businesses with higher costs. Another participant suggested the policy might have little to no impact, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 58s "}}
