A smaller share believes it could yield long-term benefits or strengthen domestic industries, and a few report mixed or limited observable effects so far.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main concerns (negative impacts highlighted):</p>\n</li>\n<li>Higher prices and inflation: Many say tariffs function as a tax on imports that companies pass to consumers, reducing purchasing power and worsening affordability of everyday goods, with particular strain on low- and middle-income households.</li>\n<li>Small business pressures: Multiple small-business owners and logistics workers report higher import costs, delayed or canceled packages, lower order volumes, and reduced work for drivers\u2014suggesting stress across retail, e-commerce, and supply chains.</li>\n<li>Economic growth risks: Commenters fear slower consumer spending, potential recession, business closures, and job losses; some cite research projecting lower long-run GDP and wages under broad tariffs.</li>\n<li>Trade relations and uncertainty: Concerns include retaliation from trading partners, damaged alliances and U.S. soft power, firms \u201cwaiting it out\u201d rather than reshoring, and policy unpredictability deterring investment.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Structural limits: Several argue that lost supply chains and manufacturing capacity cannot be quickly rebuilt, so tariffs alone won\u2019t meaningfully reshore production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Arguments in favor (positive or conditional views):</p>\n</li>\n<li>Protection and leverage: Supporters say tariffs can protect domestic industries, level the playing field, reduce trade deficits, and pressure partners into better deals.</li>\n<li>Fiscal effects: Some believe tariff revenue helps the budget and that, once the economy adjusts, benefits could emerge.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long-term lens: Even among those noting short-term pain, some anticipate eventual gains if tariffs encourage \u201cbuy American\u201d behavior and are paired with broader policy changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nuances and suggested conditions:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Several call for targeted, strategic tariffs rather than broad, universal ones, paired with diplomatic engagement, clear rules, and domestic investment to rebuild capacity.</li>\n<li>A recurring split is short-term costs versus potential long-term benefits; many doubt benefits will reach average consumers without complementary policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: The conversation leans negative, emphasizing higher consumer costs, small-business strain, and geopolitical and investment uncertainty. A notable minority expects positive outcomes if tariffs are part of a longer-term, targeted strategy with supportive domestic policies\u2014though even they often acknowledge short-term drawbacks.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 14s "}}
