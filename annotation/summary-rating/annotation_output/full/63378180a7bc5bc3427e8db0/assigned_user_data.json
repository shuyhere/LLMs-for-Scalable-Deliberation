In this model, tipping would return to its original purpose: a voluntary and optional reward for exceptional service, rather than a necessary component of a worker's income.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions for improvement include:\n*   Replacing discretionary tipping with a mandatory, fixed service charge, similar to systems in Europe or Japan.\n*   Modifying payment systems to make the \"no tip\" option more accessible and less uncomfortable to select.\n*   Restricting tipping requests to full-service environments like sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>While the system itself is heavily criticized, many individuals still feel compelled to tip, often generously.
