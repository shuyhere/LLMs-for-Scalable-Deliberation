A common theme is the belief that tipping should not be mandatory or forced. Many argue that the current system pressures customers into tipping even when no service is provided or when service is poor, and that point-of-sale systems often exacerbate this by making it difficult to decline a tip.  </p>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments suggest that the responsibility for fair compensation should fall on employers rather than customers. Many argue that service workers should be paid a livable wage, reducing the reliance on tips. Some propose alternatives, such as a fixed service charge or integrating a service fee into the bill, with tipping remaining optional. Others suggest that if tipping is to continue, it should be based on the quality of service and not be tied to every transaction.</p>\n<p>Some individuals express personal habits, such as always tipping or tipping only when service is exceptional. Others criticize the tipping culture as unnecessary or overly commercialized, especially in places where tipping was not traditionally expected. A few mention that tipping should be a voluntary act of gratitude rather than a social obligation.</p>\n<p>In summary, while there is no consensus on how to reform the tipping system, there is a general agreement that it should not be coercive, should reflect the quality of service, and should not be a substitute for fair wages. Many advocate for a shift in responsibility from the customer to the employer in ensuring service workers are adequately compensated.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 15s "}}
