They argue that access to medical care should not depend on income, employment status, or ability to pay.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>: A significant portion of respondents point out that the United States is one of the few developed nations without universal healthcare. They reference other countries, particularly Canada, as examples of successful government healthcare systems, though some note concerns about wait times.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>: Supporters argue that universal healthcare would be more cost-effective overall, creating a larger risk pool and eliminating profit-driven insurance companies. Several mention that the current system leaves many unable to afford care, leading to poor health outcomes and medical debt.</p>\n<p><strong>Social Equity</strong>: Many emphasize that government healthcare would ensure equal access regardless of race, class, income, or other factors. Some specifically mention vulnerable populations, including the unemployed, those with autoimmune conditions, and even veterans who currently struggle with healthcare access.</p>\n<p><strong>National Competitiveness</strong>: A few respondents frame healthcare as a national security issue, arguing that American workers cannot compete globally if they lack access to healthcare.</p>\n<h6>Arguments Against or Qualified Support</h6>\n<p>A small minority oppose government healthcare, citing concerns about:\n- Government inefficiency in managing programs\n- The principle that \"nothing in life is free\"\n- Increased dependency on government services\n- Potential for excessive monitoring and policies</p>\n<p>Some respondents support a hybrid approach, wanting government-provided basic insurance alongside private options to maintain choice in the healthcare system.</p>\n<h6>Overall Sentiment</h6>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents express frustration with the current healthcare system, describing it as \"wildly expensive,\" inaccessible, and failing to provide good outcomes despite high costs. They view government intervention as necessary to address these systemic failures and ensure basic healthcare access for all citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
