A majority express concerns about planned obsolescence, with many feeling that frequent releases pressure consumers into unnecessary upgrades, leading to financial strain and contributing significantly to electronic waste. There is a strong sentiment that companies prioritize profit over product longevity, often releasing minimally improved models with high price tags.</p>\n<p>Many participants also highlight negative experiences with updates, such as bugs, performance issues, and devices becoming incompatible with new software, which further forces upgrades. Environmental concerns are frequently mentioned, with calls for more sustainable practices, including longer-lasting devices and better repairability.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, some appreciate the innovation, improved security, and enhanced features that rapid updates bring.
