They argue that healthcare is a right and part of the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure citizens\u2019 safety and wellbeing. The current market-based system is seen as failing on affordability, access, and outcomes, with people unable to get care and costs deemed excessive. Universal coverage is viewed as more efficient and cheaper through broad risk pooling, aligning the U.S. with other developed countries. Commenters highlight benefits for low-income and unemployed people, earlier diagnosis and treatment for chronic and autoimmune conditions, and broader societal gains such as a more competitive workforce and enhanced national security. Many favor a government-funded basic plan, some suggest mandatory participation to reduce costs, and a subset wants a hybrid model that preserves the option of private or supplemental coverage, with an emphasis on maintaining timely care (e.g., \u201clike Canada but faster\u201d).</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}
