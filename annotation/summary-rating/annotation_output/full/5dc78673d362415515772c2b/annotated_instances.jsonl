The most prevalent argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many feel that no one should suffer, face bankruptcy, or die because they cannot afford medical care.</p>\n<p>Supporters frequently criticize the current market-based system, describing it as prohibitively expensive, inefficient, and driven by profit motives that can lead to the denial of care. They point to the successes of universal healthcare systems in other developed nations, arguing that the U.S. is lagging behind. The belief that it is a core responsibility of the government to ensure the well-being of its population was a common theme. Additionally, many argued that universal coverage would lead to better public health outcomes through increased access to preventative care, ultimately creating a healthier and more economically competitive workforce.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a minority of participants opposed the idea. Their primary concerns centered on government inefficiency, waste, and the potential for a decline in the quality of care. Some believe that healthcare is better managed by the private sector to maintain high standards. Other objections included the high cost to taxpayers, the creation of longer wait times, and a philosophical opposition to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n<p>Among those in favor, some expressed specific conditions or preferences. A few specified that a government-provided option should exist alongside private insurance to preserve consumer choice. Others conditioned their support on the system being efficient and able to provide care in a timely manner. There was also discussion about the scope of coverage, with some advocating for only \"basic\" care while others believe services like dental and vision should be included.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 57s "}}
