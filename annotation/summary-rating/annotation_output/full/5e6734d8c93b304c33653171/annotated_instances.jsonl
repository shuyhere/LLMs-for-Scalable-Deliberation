A recurring theme was the idea that tipping should be voluntary and based on the quality of service, rather than being mandatory or expected for basic transactions.</p>\n<p>Some suggested replacing the tipping system altogether, arguing that it often leads to unfair expectations or financial pressure on customers. Others proposed alternatives, such as offering incentives or rewards for tipping, like thank-you notes or coupons, to make the practice more meaningful and less transactional.</p>\n<p>Several participants emphasized the need for fair wages for service workers, advocating that the responsibility for fair compensation should fall on employers rather than customers. The idea of a livable base wage was frequently mentioned as a necessary reform to reduce the reliance on tips.</p>\n<p>A few suggested structural changes to how tipping is calculated, such as shifting from percentage-based tipping to fixed amounts, to encourage more generous tipping, especially for lower-cost services.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback reflects a desire for a more equitable and less burdensome system that supports both service workers and customers without coercion or unfair expectations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
