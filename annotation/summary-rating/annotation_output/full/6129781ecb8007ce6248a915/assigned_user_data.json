Many express frustration with being asked to tip for minimal or no service, such as picking up takeout orders, buying coffee, or completing basic transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with built-in tip screens has made it uncomfortable to decline tipping, creating a sense of pressure and obligation that many find objectionable.</p>\n<p>Respondents frequently mention feeling \"bullied\" or pressured into tipping, particularly with the awkwardness of declining tips on point-of-sale tablets. There's a strong sentiment that what was once a gesture of appreciation for exceptional service has transformed into an expected addition to every transaction.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on Wage Structure</h3>\n<p>A dominant theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and worker wages. Many respondents acknowledge that service workers, particularly in restaurants, rely heavily on tips due to inadequate base wages. While some view this as exploitative on the part of employers, others see tipping as necessary given the current wage structure.</p>\n<p>The majority of respondents who address wages advocate for paying workers a livable wage that would eliminate or reduce the necessity of tipping. There's widespread recognition that the tipped minimum wage (mentioned as $2.13/hour in one comment) is insufficient and forces workers to depend on customer generosity for survival.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Solutions and Alternatives</h3>\n<p>Respondents offer various solutions to reform or replace the current system:</p>\n<p><strong>Complete elimination of tipping</strong>: Many favor abolishing tipping entirely, with employers required to pay fair, livable wages instead.

European and Japanese models are mentioned as preferable alternatives where service charges are included or workers receive adequate wages without relying on tips.</p>\n<h3>Nuanced Views on Tipping</h3>\n<p>While the majority express negative views about current tipping practices, some respondents maintain more positive perspectives.
