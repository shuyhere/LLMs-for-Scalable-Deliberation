Many respondents acknowledge that service workers, particularly in restaurants, rely heavily on tips due to inadequate base wages. While some view this as exploitative on the part of employers, others see tipping as necessary given the current wage structure.</p>\n<p>The majority of respondents who address wages advocate for paying workers a livable wage that would eliminate or reduce the necessity of tipping.

This approach would shift the responsibility for worker compensation from customers to businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Service charges</strong>: Several respondents suggest implementing mandatory service charges (often proposed at 10%) that would be included in bills, similar to practices in other countries like Japan.</p>\n<p><strong>Reformed tipping practices</strong>: Some propose maintaining tipping but limiting it to specific contexts (primarily sit-down restaurants) and ensuring it remains truly optional without pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Better technology design</strong>: Specific suggestions include making \"no tip\" options more prominent on payment screens and only requesting tips after service has been rendered and evaluated.</p>\n<h6>International Comparisons and Cultural Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Several comments reference how other countries handle service compensation, particularly noting that the American tipping system is unique and problematic. European and Japanese models are mentioned as preferable alternatives where service charges are included or workers receive adequate wages without relying on tips.</p>\n<h6>Nuanced Views on Tipping</h6>\n<p>While the majority express negative views about current tipping practices, some respondents maintain more positive perspectives. A minority strongly support tipping, viewing it as:\n- An incentive for excellent service\n- An opportunity to show appreciation\n- A way for service workers to potentially earn above minimum wage</p>\n<p>These supporters often emphasize that they tip generously (typically mentioning 20% or more) and see it as an important part of the service economy.</p>\n<h6>Quality of Service Considerations</h6>\n<p>Many respondents connect tipping to service quality, expressing that tips should reflect the level of service received. There's a general agreement that good service deserves recognition, but disagreement about whether this should come through optional tipping or be built into pricing structures. Several mention that they adjust their tips based on service quality, while others feel obligated to tip regardless of service level.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment reflects a desire for fundamental reform of the tipping system, with most respondents favoring solutions that would provide workers with stable, adequate wages while removing the pressure and ubiquity of tipping from everyday transactions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>Overall summary of the comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broad dissatisfaction with the current tipping culture, especially the expansion of prompts to low- or no-service situations and the social pressure to tip.
