The primary justification centers on the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right that should not be dependent on an individual's income or employment status. A significant percentage of supporters point to the high cost and lack of access in the current system as evidence of market failure, arguing that a government system would ensure broader, more equitable coverage.</p>\n<p>Many comments favorably compare the U.S. to other developed nations that have implemented universal healthcare, viewing it as a marker of a advanced society and expressing confusion or frustration that the U.S. does not provide similar care. The concept of healthcare as a public good, which the government is uniquely positioned to provide without a profit motive, is a recurring theme. A smaller percentage of supportive comments do express conditions for their support, such as ensuring care is administered in a timely manner or that a private option remains available alongside a public one.</p>\n<p>A minority of contributors oppose the idea, expressing a belief that the government is inefficient and that such programs foster excessive dependency. They argue that the private sector is better suited to maintain quality and efficiency in healthcare delivery.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 6s "}}
