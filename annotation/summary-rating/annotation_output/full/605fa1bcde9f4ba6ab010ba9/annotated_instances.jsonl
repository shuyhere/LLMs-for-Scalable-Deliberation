Many feel that tipping has expanded beyond its traditional scope, with establishments that previously didn't request tips now doing so through digital payment systems. Respondents frequently describe feeling \"bullied,\" \"pressured,\" or \"forced\" into tipping, particularly with tablet-based point-of-sale systems that make it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform as Primary Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The most common proposed solution involves employers paying livable wages to eliminate workers' dependence on tips. Many respondents believe the responsibility for fair compensation should rest with employers rather than customers. Several note that the United States is unique in its tipping culture and suggest adopting European models where service charges are integrated into pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong></p>\n<p>Among those who support tipping in principle, most believe it should be:\n- Voluntary rather than mandatory\n- Based on quality of service received\n- Reserved for situations where actual service is provided\n- Given after service is rendered, not before</p>\n<p><strong>Specific Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Respondents highlighted several problematic aspects:\n- Digital payment systems defaulting to high tip percentages\n- Requests for tips in self-service situations\n- The awkwardness of navigating \"no tip\" options\n- Financial strain on customers from expanded tipping expectations\n- Workers' vulnerability due to low base wages</p>\n<p><strong>Reform Suggestions</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond wage increases, respondents proposed various improvements:\n- Simplified, prominent \"no tip\" options on payment screens\n- Service charges incorporated into menu prices\n- Standardized tipping guidelines based on purchase levels\n- Recognition systems for tippers (thank you notes, coupons)\n- Clear differentiation between service and non-service transactions</p>\n<p>While a small minority express strong support for tipping as a way to reward good service and help workers, the overwhelming sentiment favors significant reform or elimination of the current tipping system in favor of fair, stable wages for all workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
