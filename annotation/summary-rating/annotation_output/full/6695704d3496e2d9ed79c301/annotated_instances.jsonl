Supporters express confidence in the business acumen behind the policy decisions and suggest that while immediate effects may seem challenging, the long-term benefits will justify the approach. Some see this as an opportunity for the U.S. to prioritize domestic economic growth and help American workers rise from poverty, particularly given current challenges where even dual-income households struggle financially. A portion of supporters report not seeing significant price increases or import disruptions yet.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those opposing the tariffs highlight immediate negative consequences: widespread price increases affecting everyday consumers, harm to small businesses, and damage to international trade relationships, particularly with China. Critics argue the policy primarily benefits the wealthy while increasing the cost of living and inflation for average Americans. They point to other countries already seeking alternative trade partners, potentially isolating the U.S. economically. Several express concern that the tariffs aren't creating meaningful job opportunities for American workers while still imposing financial burdens on consumers.</p>\n<p>The division appears to center on whether short-term economic pain will lead to long-term benefits, with supporters taking a more patient, forward-looking stance while critics focus on immediate negative impacts on affordability and international relations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
