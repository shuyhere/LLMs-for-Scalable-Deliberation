The most prevalent concern is that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers. Many commenters noted that companies pass the cost on to customers, resulting in increased prices for everyday goods, rising inflation, and a higher cost of living that disproportionately affects struggling Americans. The negative effects on businesses, particularly small businesses that rely on imported goods, were also frequently mentioned. Other negative consequences cited include damage to international relationships, the risk of retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and isolating the U.S. from global trade. There was also skepticism that the policy would succeed in its goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who viewed the tariffs positively often believe they will benefit the U.S. economy, particularly in the long run. Arguments in favor of the policy suggest that it corrects unfair trade practices, generates significant revenue for the government, and helps make American products more competitive. A common theme among supporters was the idea that any current negative effects are temporary hardships that will lead to a stronger, more stable economy in the future.</p>\n<p>A few comments expressed a mixed view, acknowledging that while tariffs might protect some domestic industries, they also harm consumers and other sectors of the economy. One commenter suggested the policy might have little impact, as companies find ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}
