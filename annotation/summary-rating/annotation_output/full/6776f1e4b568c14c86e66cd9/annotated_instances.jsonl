Many express frustration with the expectation to tip for minimal or no service, particularly with the proliferation of digital payment systems that prompt for a tip during routine transactions.</p>\n<p>A significant majority advocate for systemic change, emphasizing that employers should pay a living wage so that workers do not have to rely on tips to make ends meet. This is seen as the primary solution to what many describe as an unfair and broken system. There is notable support for modeling changes after practices in places like Europe, where tipping is less common because service workers are compensated adequately.</p>\n<p>Opinions on how to improve tipping, if it is to remain, include making it more transparent and voluntary, basing it strictly on service quality, simplifying it to fixed amounts instead of percentages, and ensuring the process of declining to tip is not cumbersome or guilt-inducing. A minority of voices support tipping as a positive way to show appreciation, but even within this group, many feel it should be an optional extra for exceptional service, not a mandatory expectation. Overall, the prevailing sentiment is that the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with employers, not customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}
