It is valued for idea generation, learning technical topics, and even providing entertainment and personal reflection (e.g., checking reactions in conflicts). Some note that AI feels like a modern, easier alternative to traditional research methods. However, reliability is a recurring concern: users report occasional inaccuracy, relevance issues, and source bias, prompting the need for fact\u2011checking.
