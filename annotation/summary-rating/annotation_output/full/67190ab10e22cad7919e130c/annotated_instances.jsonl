If the staff provides good service you can simply add the amount you feel is appropriate on the indicated line of the check.

I would eliminate this practice for service which requires very little skill or effort."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 5s "}}

Most respondents express frustration with the expansion of tipping requests beyond traditional service settings, particularly criticizing point-of-sale systems that prompt for tips in situations where minimal or no service is provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Key concerns about the current system:</strong>\n- Tipping has expanded far beyond restaurants to include counter service, pickup orders, and basic transactions where it feels inappropriate\n- The pressure to tip has become uncomfortable and feels mandatory rather than voluntary\n- Workers are underpaid and forced to rely on tips for basic income\n- The system allows employers to avoid paying fair wages by shifting the burden to customers</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed solutions fall into several categories:</strong></p>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents advocate for completely abolishing the tipping system, with employers required to pay workers a living wage instead. Many suggest this would align the U.S. with international standards, particularly European models where tipping is minimal or unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Others propose reforming rather than eliminating tipping by:\n- Making it truly optional and based on service quality\n- Implementing service charges (around 10%) instead of variable tips\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service situations\n- Removing pre-service tip requests and aggressive point-of-sale prompts</p>\n<p>Those who support tipping emphasize it should reward exceptional service and provide incentive for workers to excel. However, even supporters often acknowledge the system needs boundaries and shouldn't extend to every transaction.</p>\n<p>The consensus clearly indicates that while people want service workers to earn fair wages, the current tipping culture has become excessive, creating an unsustainable system that benefits employers at the expense of both workers and customers. Most respondents would prefer a straightforward pricing model where workers receive adequate base pay without depending on customer generosity for survival.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 37s "}}
