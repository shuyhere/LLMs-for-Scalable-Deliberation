Many emphasize that helping those fleeing danger is \"the right thing to do\" and reflects American values of compassion and freedom. Supporters frequently reference America's history as a nation built by immigrants and refugees, with some noting Native American perspectives on land and belonging. Several respondents point out that the U.S. often bears some responsibility for conflicts that create refugees, particularly through foreign policy decisions and arms sales. Many express empathy, stating they would want help if they were in similar circumstances.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns and conditions</strong> are raised even among those who support accepting refugees. The most common stipulation is the need for thorough vetting and background checks to ensure public safety and exclude those with criminal histories. Many emphasize the importance of proper documentation and legal processes. Some suggest limits on numbers to prevent strain on resources and ensure current citizens' needs are met. Several respondents worry about the economic impact and competition for resources between citizens and refugees.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to accepting more refugees</strong> centers primarily on economic concerns and the belief that America should \"take care of its own\" first. Opponents cite national debt, struggling citizens, and strained systems as reasons to limit refugee acceptance. Some express frustration that refugees receive aid while American citizens are denied assistance. A few mention concerns about overwhelming numbers and suggest refugees should seek help in neighboring countries instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Middle ground positions</strong> are notable, with many respondents expressing conflicted feelings or conditional support. These comments often acknowledge both humanitarian obligations and practical concerns about implementation, suggesting balanced approaches that help refugees while protecting American interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical suggestions</strong> include settling refugees in rural areas to boost local economies, ensuring proper integration and education about American society, working with allies to distribute refugees among multiple countries, and maintaining strict oversight of refugee programs.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect deep divisions but also shared concerns about balancing humanitarian values with practical considerations of resources, security, and the wellbeing of current citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 21s "}}
