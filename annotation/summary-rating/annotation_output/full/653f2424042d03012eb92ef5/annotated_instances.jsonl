These supporters frequently argue that the current private, for-profit system is failing, leading to prohibitive costs, medical debt, and preventable suffering. They point to the success of universal healthcare systems in other developed nations as a model the U.S. should follow. A common sentiment is that access to care should not be dependent on income or employment status, and that a government system would improve public health outcomes and be more efficient and cost-effective for society as a whole.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express opposition or significant reservations. The primary concerns center on a belief that government involvement would be inefficient, reduce the quality of care, and lead to increased wait times. Some opponents prefer a system that retains a strong role for private insurance and individual choice. Another portion of comments express conditional or partial support, advocating for a hybrid system that includes a public option alongside private alternatives, or emphasizing that any government plan must ensure care is both accessible and timely to be effective.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 58s "}}
