A substantial percentage of participants argued that the most effective improvement would be to require businesses to pay their employees a livable wage, thereby removing the workers' dependency on tips for their income. This would shift the responsibility of fair compensation from the customer to the employer.</p>\n<p>Many expressed frustration with the expansion of tipping requests into situations where minimal or no service is provided, such as for takeout orders or basic transactions. The use of tablet payment systems was frequently cited as a source of social pressure, creating an uncomfortable experience where customers feel \"bullied\" or \"forced\" into tipping.</p>\n<p>There is a strong sentiment that tipping should be a voluntary reward for high-quality or exceptional service, rather than a mandatory obligation. Several participants stated they base their tips directly on the quality of service they receive, rewarding good service while feeling no obligation to tip for poor service.</p>\n<p>In addition to advocating for higher base wages, commentators suggested several other reforms. Some proposed replacing the current system with a mandatory service charge included in the bill. Other ideas for improvement included standardizing tip amounts instead of using percentages and redesigning payment screens to make declining a tip easier and less awkward.</p>\n<p>While criticism was widespread, a smaller portion of commentators view tipping positively, seeing it as a necessary way to supplement workers' low incomes or as a good deed to show appreciation for their skills and hard work.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}
