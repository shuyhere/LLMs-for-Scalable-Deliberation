Many supporters reference the historical role of the U.S. as a nation of immigrants and note that offering refuge aligns with values of freedom and safety. Some supporters also mention the importance of cultural diversity and potential benefits to society.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments express conditional support, advocating for thorough vetting processes to ensure security, background checks to screen for criminal history, and limits on numbers to avoid straining public resources. These comments often stress the need for a balanced approach that considers both the welfare of refugees and the existing population, ensuring citizens' quality of life is not negatively impacted.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments oppose accepting more refugees, primarily citing concerns over economic strain, existing national debt, and the need to address domestic issues first. Some opponents also express worries about integration challenges, potential increases in crime, or the belief that refugees should seek safety in neighboring countries rather than traveling long distances.</p>\n<p>Overall, while humanitarian concerns and moral obligations are frequently highlighted, practical considerations regarding vetting, resource allocation, and national capacity are also prominent in the discussion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
