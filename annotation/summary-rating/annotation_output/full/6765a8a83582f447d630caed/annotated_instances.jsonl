This support is largely driven by a sense of moral and humanitarian responsibility, with many expressing empathy and the belief that it is the \"right thing to do.\" Commenters often cited the nation's identity as a safe haven, founded by people escaping similar circumstances, and the idea that a wealthy nation with abundant resources has a duty to help those in life-threatening situations. Some also feel the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees, especially when the crises are a result of American foreign policy.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently accompanied by significant conditions and concerns. The most common condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Many who support accepting refugees also believe there must be limits on the number of people admitted and a balanced approach to ensure that resources are not strained and that the needs of current citizens are not overlooked.</p>\n<p>A distinct group of commenters opposes accepting more refugees. Their primary argument is that the U.S. should prioritize its own domestic problems, such as national debt and caring for its struggling citizens. They express concern that accepting more refugees strains the economy and social systems, diverting essential resources from Americans in need. Some also feel that the U.S. is already overwhelmed and that refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
