A central theme is the moral argument that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and that people should not suffer or die because they cannot afford care.</p>\n<p>Participants frequently criticized the current market-based system, describing it as failing to provide for the social good, being wildly expensive, and yielding poor health outcomes. They argued that a government-provided system would be more efficient and cheaper by ensuring universal participation. Several commenters pointed to other developed nations as proof that such systems are successful and questioned why the U.S. does not provide the same for its citizens.</p>\n<p>The economic well-being of the country was also cited as a reason for support, with arguments that a healthy workforce is necessary to compete globally, framing healthcare as a national security issue. While the support was widespread, some specific conditions were mentioned. One commenter expressed a desire for a system similar to Canada's but with faster service, while another supported a government option as long as it was not the <em>only</em> choice available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
