Commenters consistently describe healthcare as a fundamental human right rather than a luxury, emphasizing that no one should be denied care due to cost. Many express frustration with the current system, citing problems with affordability, accessibility, and health outcomes.</p>\n<p>A common theme is the belief that government intervention would create a more efficient and equitable system, with several references to successful models in other countries. Some supporters frame universal healthcare as an economic necessity, arguing that it would improve national competitiveness and workforce health. Others view it as a moral obligation of government to ensure citizen well-being and safety.</p>\n<p>While the vast majority express clear support, one comment suggests conditional approval, preferring that government-provided healthcare not be the only option available.
