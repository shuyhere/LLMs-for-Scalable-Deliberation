A significant portion of the feedback supports eliminating or reforming the current system, particularly in situations where tipping feels mandatory or inapplicable. Some suggest removing the tipping system entirely, especially where it is not relevant to the service provided, while others advocate for making tipping voluntary and eliminating forced or implied tipping.</p>\n<p>Several commenters emphasize the need for fair wages for service workers, arguing that tipping should not be a substitute for a livable hourly wage.

I mean I\u2019m not going to eat to give away $30-$40 to a waiter or waitress five dollars tops for me and given that this waitress of waiter or get five dollars minimum from an eight hour shift they almost made their whole salary or at least a quarter of it and just tips so I don\u2019t feel bad if I don\u2019t give them but a dollar or two.
