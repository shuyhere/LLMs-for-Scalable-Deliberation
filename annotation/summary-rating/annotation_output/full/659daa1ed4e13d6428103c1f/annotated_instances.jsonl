Many emphasize that anonymity is a crucial freedom online, allowing for expression without fear of professional or personal repercussions, and is particularly important for marginalized groups or those in unsafe environments.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial number of commentators support the idea, arguing that it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, and scams, and help combat malicious activities like impersonation and the use of bots. Proponents believe that linking online behavior to a real identity would encourage more responsible conduct.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of commentators express mixed or conditional views, acknowledging potential benefits for safety and accountability but also recognizing significant privacy risks. Some suggest a middle ground, such as optional real-name use or verification systems that do not publicly display personal information.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation reflects a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the need to protect individual privacy and freedom of expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
