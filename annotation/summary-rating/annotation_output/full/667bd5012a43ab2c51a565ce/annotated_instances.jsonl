A significant portion of the feedback highlights the negative consequences of reduced funding, such as harm to students, educators, and the broader society. Many emphasize the importance of education as a foundation for future success, innovation, and national competitiveness. Some commenters also raise concerns about the long-term effects of funding cuts, including a decline in research, reduced opportunities, and the potential for the U.S. to fall behind in science and other fields.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of commenters suggest that there may be some justification for reducing funding, often citing political or ideological concerns, but also express worries about the impact on independent thinking. A few commenters state that they lack sufficient information to form an opinion, while others criticize the policy as short-sighted or harmful to vulnerable populations, such as students who cannot afford higher education.</p>\n<p>In summary, the comments reflect a strong consensus on the value of education and the risks associated with cutting academic funding, with only a small percentage offering conditional support or neutrality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 25s "}}
