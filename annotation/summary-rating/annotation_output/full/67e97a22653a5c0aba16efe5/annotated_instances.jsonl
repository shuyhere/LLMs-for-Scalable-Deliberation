A significant portion of respondents express frustration, viewing frequent updates as driven by profit motives rather than meaningful improvements. Many describe this cycle as promoting planned obsolescence, increasing electronic waste, and placing financial pressure on consumers to upgrade unnecessarily. Concerns about environmental sustainability and excessive consumerism are frequently raised.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some acknowledge benefits such as enhanced security, better performance, and access to new features, which keep devices functional and secure. A minority appreciate the pace of innovation, seeing it as a sign of technological progress.</p>\n<p>There is a notable desire for a slower, more deliberate update cycle\u2014often suggested at two years or more\u2014to allow for substantial improvements, reduce waste, and lessen consumer pressure. Others emphasize that incremental updates often feel insignificant and advocate for better support and longevity of existing devices rather than constant new releases.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 17s "}}
