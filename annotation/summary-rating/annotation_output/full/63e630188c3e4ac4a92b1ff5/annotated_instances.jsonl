They argue that it is a compassionate and ethical duty to offer safety to those fleeing life-threatening situations like war and persecution. Many express empathy, stating they would want the same help if they were in a similar situation. This perspective is often linked to American identity, with some citing the nation's history as a country founded by people escaping persecution and its role as a global leader with the resources to help. Others believe the U.S. has a responsibility to accept refugees, particularly when its foreign policy may have contributed to the instability in other countries.</p>\n<p>Conversely, another group of commenters opposes accepting more refugees. The primary reason cited is the belief that the country should prioritize its own citizens and domestic problems first. Concerns include the national debt, the strain on social systems, and the competition for resources that could negatively impact Americans. Some express that the current immigration system is already overwhelmed and that an influx of refugees could exacerbate issues like crime and economic hardship.</p>\n<p>A substantial portion of participants hold a conditional or conflicted view. While they support the principle of accepting refugees, they emphasize the importance of strict conditions. The most frequently mentioned condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out criminals. Many also call for limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid overwhelming the country's resources and economy. These commenters seek a balanced approach that allows for compassion while safeguarding the interests and quality of life of current citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 48s "}}
