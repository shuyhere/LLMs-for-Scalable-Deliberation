Roughly 75\u201380% are supportive, about 20% are opposed, and a small share are undecided.</p>\n<p>Reasons for support\n- Humanitarian and moral duty: protecting innocent lives, offering safety, and upholding human rights.\n- National identity and history: the U.S. as a refuge for those escaping tyranny; setting a global example.\n- Capacity and benefits: belief that the U.S. has the resources; potential cultural and economic gains; some note responsibility when U.S. foreign policy contributes to crises.</p>\n<p>Common conditions and guardrails\n- Rigorous vetting: thorough background checks, excluding criminals, and distinguishing refugees from economic migrants.\n- Capacity-based limits: set practical intake caps to avoid negative impacts on citizens and the economy.\n- Integration measures: education on laws and norms, language and job training, and dispersing resettlement to less-populated or rural areas; some suggest temporary camps with skills programs.\n- Monitoring impacts: willingness to scale support if economic effects turn negative.</p>\n<p>Reasons for opposition\n- Resource strain and prioritization: concerns about debt, social services, jobs, and taking care of citizens first.\n- Security and pace: fear that rapid intake undermines effective vetting.\n- Alternative pathways: preference for refugees to seek protection in neighboring countries.\n- Perceptions of unfairness: belief that newcomers receive more support than citizens in need.</p>\n<p>Notable suggestions and nuances\n- Prioritize refugees from under-supported regions (e.g., parts of Africa) or those displaced by conflicts tied to U.S. actions.\n- Ensure transparent criteria for refugee status and clear limits.\n- Broad cross-cutting agreement on the need for strong vetting and a balance between compassion and domestic capacity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 2s "}}
