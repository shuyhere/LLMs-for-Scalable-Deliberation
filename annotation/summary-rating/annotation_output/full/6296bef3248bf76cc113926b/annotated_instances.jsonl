Supporters emphasized the <strong>protection of public health</strong>, the <strong>greater good</strong>, and the <strong>prevention of widespread harm</strong>. Many cited the <strong>experience of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> as a justification, noting how these measures helped reduce transmission and save lives. Some highlighted the <strong>scientific basis</strong> for vaccines and the importance of <strong>herd immunity</strong>. Others pointed to the <strong>necessity of government intervention</strong> when individual choices risk public health, especially in times of crisis.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable share of comments <strong>opposed</strong> mandatory measures, often citing <strong>individual rights</strong>, <strong>personal freedom</strong>, and <strong>lack of trust in government</strong>. Concerns were raised about the <strong>safety and efficacy of vaccines</strong>, particularly when developed under <strong>time constraints</strong>, and about <strong>government overreach</strong>. Some expressed frustration with how the government handled the pandemic, which led to <strong>distrust in its ability to make sound public health decisions</strong>. A few also raised concerns about <strong>informed consent</strong>, <strong>long-term side effects</strong>, and <strong>transparency in vaccine development</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some respondents held <strong>mixed views</strong>, supporting <strong>quarantine measures</strong> but opposing <strong>mandatory vaccination</strong>, or agreeing with government authority only under certain conditions\u2014such as when vaccines are <strong>proven effective</strong>, <strong>safely tested</strong>, and <strong>freely available</strong> to all. A few emphasized the <strong>importance of public education and trust-building</strong> as an alternative to enforcement.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a <strong>polarized but thoughtful discussion</strong>, balancing the <strong>need for public health protection</strong> with <strong>concerns about individual rights and government accountability</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 10s "}}
