Many view these cuts as short-sighted, potentially harming students, limiting innovation, and weakening the United States' global standing. A smaller percentage support the reductions, citing concerns about wasteful spending, ideological bias in academia, or the need for local control over education. Overall, the prevailing sentiment emphasizes education as a critical investment for societal progress and expresses worry about negative consequences for future generations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
