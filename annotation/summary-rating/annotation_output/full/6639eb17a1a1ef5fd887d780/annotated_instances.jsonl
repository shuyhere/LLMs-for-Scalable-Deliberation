A significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating the tipping system entirely, citing concerns about its expansion into inappropriate contexts and the pressure customers feel to tip even for minimal or no service.</p>\n<h6>Key Themes</h6>\n<p><strong>Tipping Fatigue and Overreach</strong>\nMany participants express frustration that tipping has expanded beyond traditional service roles. There's particular irritation about being prompted to tip for basic transactions, pickup orders, and situations where minimal service is provided. The prevalence of digital payment systems with preset tip options is seen as creating uncomfortable pressure on customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform as Primary Solution</strong>\nThe most common proposed solution is for employers to pay livable wages, removing workers' dependence on tips. Participants recognize that many service workers currently rely on tips due to inadequate base pay, but believe the responsibility for fair compensation should rest with employers, not customers.</p>\n<p><strong>International Perspective</strong>\nSeveral comments reference how the U.S. tipping system differs from other countries, particularly Europe, where service charges are often included in prices and workers receive higher base wages. This comparison is used to argue that alternative systems are both possible and preferable.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some participants support tipping when it genuinely rewards exceptional service. These respondents distinguish between voluntary appreciation for good service and mandatory or expected tipping regardless of service quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Reform Suggestions</strong>\nAmong those suggesting modifications rather than elimination, proposals include:\n- Making tipping truly optional with easier \"no tip\" options on payment systems\n- Implementing fixed service charges instead of percentage-based tips\n- Ensuring tips are only requested after service is rendered and can be evaluated\n- Creating clearer standards for when tipping is appropriate</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment strongly favors either eliminating tipping entirely or significantly reforming the system to reduce customer pressure while ensuring workers receive fair compensation through adequate wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 3s "}}
