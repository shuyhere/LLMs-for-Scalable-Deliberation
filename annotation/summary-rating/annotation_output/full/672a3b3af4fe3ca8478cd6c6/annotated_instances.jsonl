These comments frequently characterize the decision as short-sighted, arguing it will harm students, stifle innovation (particularly in medical and scientific research), weaken the country's long-term economic competitiveness, and make the population more vulnerable to manipulation. A common sentiment is that this action undermines the future of young Americans and risks ceding America's leadership in research and development to other countries.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the critical comments go further, attributing malicious intent to the decision. They suggest the cuts are a deliberate strategy to keep the population less educated and thus easier to control, or to dismantle public institutions. Some also express concern that the cuts will disproportionately harm lower-income families and communities of color, limiting social mobility.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments voice support for the funding cuts. The justification provided is typically that academic institutions are inefficient, misuse funds, or are promoting specific political ideologies rather than education. These commentators believe the cuts could force a necessary overhaul of the education system or that education is better administered at the state and local level.</p>\n<p>A very small percentage of commentators abstained from offering a firm opinion, stating they lacked sufficient information to form one.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 39s "}}
