The prevailing preference is to shift responsibility to businesses to provide a livable base wage so that tips become optional rather than essential income. Many want tipping reserved for clear, quality service and strongly oppose prompts for minimal or no service, pre-service tipping requests, and aggressive point-of-sale defaults that make it hard to decline.</p>\n<p>Common reform ideas include: guaranteeing minimum/livable wages for traditionally tipped roles; abolishing mandatory tipping; integrating service charges into prices or adding a modest, automatic service fee with optional tipping removed from the bill; improving checkout design with an easy \u201cno tip\u201d option and only prompting after service; and limiting tipping requests to contexts with genuine service. Some suggest standardizing or simplifying tipping (e.g., fixed amounts instead of percentages), offering small reciprocation for tips (thank-you notes or coupons), or reducing tax burdens on tips.</p>\n<p>A minority favor more robust tipping norms\u2014always tipping or even tipping higher\u2014emphasizing recognition for difficult service work. Still, the broad direction is toward fair base compensation and a tipping system that is voluntary, merit-based, and free of social pressure.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 58s "}}
