Roughly 75% express clear support, about 15\u201320% support it with conditions (e.g., preserving choice and ensuring timely, quality care), and under 10% oppose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main reasons for support:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Health care framed as a human right and a core government responsibility.</li>\n<li>Affordability and access: many cannot afford private insurance; current costs are seen as prohibitive.</li>\n<li>International comparisons: other developed countries\u2019 systems cited as workable models (e.g., Canada, \u201cmost developed nations\u201d).</li>\n<li>Preventive care and early detection expected to improve outcomes and reduce long-term costs (mentions of autoimmune conditions, routine care, dental/vision).</li>\n<li>Economic arguments: reduced medical debt/bankruptcy, improved workforce productivity and competitiveness; some see it as a national security issue.</li>\n<li>Equity: ensuring equal care regardless of income, status, or demographics; decoupling coverage from employment.</li>\n<li>\n<p>System reform: dissatisfaction with for-profit insurers\u2019 incentives; belief that risk pooling/universal enrollment would increase efficiency; some point to Medicare as a scalable foundation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Design preferences among supporters:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Public option alongside private plans to preserve choice; avoid a single mandated option.</li>\n<li>A basic, universal tier with timely access and strong quality standards; some want dental and vision included.</li>\n<li>Eligibility debates: some prefer coverage for citizens only; others imply universal residence-based coverage.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Affordability targets (e.g., modest premiums) and clarity that taxpayers should see benefits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concerns and objections:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Government inefficiency, bureaucracy, and potential overreach/monitoring.</li>\n<li>High taxpayer costs and potential crowd-out of other public services.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fears of reduced quality compared to private sector; preference to limit dependency on government.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perceived problems in the current system:</p>\n</li>\n<li>High premiums, copays, and medical debt; people forgo care due to cost.</li>\n<li>Limited access and poor outcomes despite high spending.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Medicaid eligibility seen as too restrictive; hospitals face payment uncertainty.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Expected benefits if implemented:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Earlier diagnoses and better population health.</li>\n<li>Lower emergency and catastrophic costs; reduced uncompensated care.</li>\n<li>Less medical debt and financial stress; more stable, fair, and cohesive society.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: Most commenters favor a government-provided basic coverage model, often paired with private options, emphasizing affordability, preventive care, and equitable access.
