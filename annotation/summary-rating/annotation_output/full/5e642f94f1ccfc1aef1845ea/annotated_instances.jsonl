A significant portion of the feedback is positive, with many acknowledging the value influencers bring in terms of entertainment, information, and accessibility. Commenters often highlight how influencers provide relatable content, shape trends, and offer alternative sources of news and education. Some compare them to traditional media or entertainment industries, noting their role in democratizing content creation and giving a platform to everyday individuals.</p>\n<p>At the same time, several commenters express concerns about authenticity, oversaturation, and the potential for negative influence. Some argue that the profession lacks regulation and accountability, which can lead to misleading content or unrealistic portrayals of success. A recurring theme is the idea that while the profession can be valid and beneficial, it also carries significant responsibility.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of commenters express more critical or dismissive views, describing influencers as inauthentic or contributing to societal fragmentation. A few reference cultural or religious metaphors to express unease about the growing influence of online personalities.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments suggest a nuanced and evolving perception of internet influencers as a legitimate profession, with recognition of both opportunities and challenges.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 53s "}}
