They acknowledge clear benefits\u2014frequent innovation, improved performance and cameras, security enhancements, and the convenience of always-available information\u2014yet voice stronger concerns about downsides. Common frustrations include devices feeling outdated quickly, pressure to upgrade, perceived planned obsolescence (shorter device lifespans and issues arising near the end of payment plans), and accessory churn due to changing charger standards. Economic and supply factors\u2014rising prices, resource constraints, and tariffs\u2014add to skepticism. Several note that annual releases yield diminishing real-world improvements as the technology matures. Many prefer longer release cadences (around 2.5\u20133 years), longer software support, and a focus on durability and refining existing products. Overall, the sentiment leans toward caution: the rapid cycle is seen as delivering benefits but often at a consumer cost that may outweigh the gains.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
