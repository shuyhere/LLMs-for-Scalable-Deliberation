Many believe that companies will pass the increased costs of tariffs directly onto their customers, increasing inflation and the cost of everyday living. This is seen as particularly harmful to the middle class and those already struggling financially, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and a broader economic downturn.</p>\n<p>Several commentators also express skepticism that the policy will achieve its goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. They argue that it is still cheaper for companies to produce goods overseas and absorb the tariff cost by raising prices. Additionally, some point out that global supply chains are difficult to rebuild and that the policy creates uncertainty, which discourages investment. Other negative consequences mentioned include damaging international relations, particularly with China, causing other countries to seek new trade partners, and tarnishing the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable trading partner.</p>\n<p><strong>Arguments for a Positive Impact</strong>\nSupporters of the policy often frame it as a beneficial long-term strategy, even if it causes short-term difficulties. The core belief is that the tariffs are a necessary step to correct unfair trade practices where other countries were not paying their share, which contributed to U.S. debt. By leveling the playing field, proponents argue the policy will protect domestic industries, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, and ultimately help lift American workers out of poverty. Some also express confidence in the administration's business expertise, believing the decisions will benefit the country in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed or Nuanced Views</strong>\nA few comments offered a more mixed perspective. One suggested the policy is largely ineffective because companies are finding ways to work around it. Another pointed out that while tariffs may protect certain domestic industries, they simultaneously raise costs for others and create economic uncertainty.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 24s "}}
