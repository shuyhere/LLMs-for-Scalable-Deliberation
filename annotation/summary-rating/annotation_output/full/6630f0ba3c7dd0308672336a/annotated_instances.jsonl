Many express empathy, stating that offering a safe haven is the right and kind thing to do for people, including innocent children and families, facing life-threatening situations. Several arguments are rooted in the belief that it is a core part of the nation's identity, founded on principles of fleeing persecution. Others point to a moral obligation stemming from the U.S.'s foreign policy, arguing that the country should help those displaced by conflicts it may have influenced. The potential for cultural enrichment and boosting populations in rural areas were also cited as benefits.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently conditional. The most common condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Many supporters also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted and a balanced approach that ensures the needs of current citizens are met first, preventing a strain on resources and the economy.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters oppose accepting more refugees. Their primary concern is the economic burden and the strain on social systems. They argue that the government should prioritize its own citizens, many of whom are struggling, before taking on the responsibility of caring for others. Some also believe that refugees are overwhelming the country and should seek asylum in nations closer to their own.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 13s "}}
