These individuals argue that such actions are necessary to protect public health, prevent the spread of disease, and achieve herd immunity. Many cite the recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification, noting how the lack of compliance with these measures led to preventable deaths and prolonged disruptions.

These individuals often express concerns about bodily autonomy, government overreach, and a lack of trust in public health institutions. Some argue that vaccines and quarantine should be encouraged but not mandated, as people should have the right to make personal health decisions.
