Critics describe the policy as short-sighted and harmful.\n- Anticipated consequences include reduced educational quality and resources, diminished access for low-income students and adult learners, weakened research capacity and innovation (including medical research), potential brain drain to other countries, and long-term declines in national competitiveness.\n- A small minority express conditional or mixed views: one cites perceived ideological bias in academia as partial justification but worries about chilling independent thought; another trusts that leaders may have reasons but emphasizes the need for viable alternatives to avoid decline; one person is undecided and requests more details.\n- Common threads across perspectives highlight that investment in education typically yields long-term benefits, and any policy changes should protect access, safety, research, and educational quality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
