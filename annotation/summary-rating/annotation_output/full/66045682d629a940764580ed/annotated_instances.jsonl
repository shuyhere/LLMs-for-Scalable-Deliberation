A common theme is the belief that tipping should be tied to the quality of service and should never be mandatory. Many respondents express frustration with the growing expectation of tipping in situations where service is minimal or nonexistent, such as for takeout or drive-thru orders.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current system for placing undue financial pressure on consumers and for allowing employers to pay low base wages, effectively shifting the responsibility of fair compensation onto customers. Several respondents suggest that a solution lies in raising the minimum wage for service workers so that tips are not necessary for survival. Others propose alternative models, such as a fixed service charge added to the bill, to replace or supplement tipping.</p>\n<p>Some support the idea of tipping as a voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service, but they emphasize that it should not be forced or expected. A few suggest that tipping should be more structured, such as through fixed amounts or clearer guidelines, to reduce ambiguity and pressure.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a smaller number of respondents defend the tipping system, viewing it as a fair and flexible way to reward excellent service. However, even among these supporters, there is a general consensus that service workers deserve better base pay and that the tipping culture has become excessive in many contexts.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback highlights a growing dissatisfaction with the current tipping system, particularly in the United States, and a desire for a more equitable and less intrusive approach to compensating service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
