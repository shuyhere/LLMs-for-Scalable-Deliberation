Many warn of long-term economic and competitiveness losses, potential brain drain to other countries, and erosion of trust in institutions. Some also frame the move as politically motivated or authoritarian and worry about disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities.\n- Supportive or mixed perspectives: A minority believe reductions are justified due to perceived ideological bias or waste in academia, express trust that leadership has valid reasons, or hope cuts could spur reform and reduce student debt. Several call for details, urge a balanced approach that targets waste while maintaining critical education and research funding, and emphasize the need for alternatives if cuts proceed.\n- Tone: Predominantly urgent and critical, with strong language from opponents; a smaller share is cautious, conditional, or neutral.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": 30, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary of the comments:\n- Sentiment: The reaction is overwhelmingly negative toward cutting academic funding.
