Several participants note that tariffs are already leading to price increases, contributing to inflation and making everyday living more expensive. There's particular concern about the burden on small businesses, with some viewing the policy as disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. Additionally, participants worry about damaged international relationships, particularly with China, and question whether the tariffs are actually creating meaningful employment opportunities for U.S. citizens. Some observe that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading partners, potentially isolating the U.S. from global markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for the tariff policy</strong> is based on several key beliefs. Some participants view the tariffs as a necessary correction to what they perceive as historically unfair trade relationships where other countries paid little or no tariffs to the U.S. Supporters see this as a way to reduce national debt and stabilize the economy in the long term. There's also a perspective that these policies will help lift American workers out of poverty by protecting domestic jobs and industries, addressing the current struggle where even dual-income households face financial challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>Underlying themes</strong> reveal a tension between short-term costs and potential long-term benefits. While opponents focus on immediate price increases and economic disruption, supporters express faith in the business acumen behind the policies and believe temporary discomfort will lead to future prosperity. The debate also reflects broader questions about America's role in the global economy and whether protectionist measures or free trade better serve the nation's interests.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect the complex and controversial nature of tariff policy, with reasonable people drawing very different conclusions about its economic impact based on their priorities and perspectives.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
