Many characterized the decision as \"short-sighted,\" \"foolish,\" or \"terrible,\" emphasizing that education serves as the foundation for society and all other professions.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary concerns raised include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Impact on students and accessibility</strong>: Respondents worried that funding cuts would harm students who cannot afford college and limit educational opportunities for both young people and adults seeking to further their education.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Research and innovation</strong>: Multiple comments highlighted how cuts would damage critical research, including medical and cancer research, potentially costing billions of dollars and lives. Several noted that researchers might leave for other countries, benefiting America's competitors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Long-term national competitiveness</strong>: Many viewed the cuts as detrimental to America's future, arguing that strong economies depend on well-educated populations and that reducing educational investment weakens the country's competitive position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quality of education</strong>: Concerns were raised about declining educational quality and resources for learning, with some noting that American education already faces challenges with access and literacy rates.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A small minority offered different perspectives, with some suggesting the cuts might be justified due to perceived political bias in academic institutions or that education needs restructuring. A few respondents indicated they needed more information to form an opinion or expressed general trust in the administration's decision-making.</p>\n<p>Some comments also suggested political motivations behind the cuts, viewing them as attempts to control the population or as part of a broader pattern of harmful policies. Overall, the sentiment strongly favored maintaining or increasing academic funding rather than implementing cuts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
