A significant majority express deep concern, viewing such cuts as detrimental to education, research, and the nation's long-term future. They argue that education is the foundation of society and that reducing funding harms students, limits opportunities for innovation, weakens national competitiveness, and disproportionately affects those who cannot afford education.
