Many express frustration with the pervasive and often pressured nature of tipping, particularly with the proliferation of digital payment systems that prompt for a tip at nearly every transaction, including counter-service and pick-up orders. This is widely seen as an overextension of a practice that should be reserved for sit-down restaurants where personalized service is provided.</p>\n<p>A predominant theme is the belief that employers should bear the responsibility of paying a living wage to their employees, eliminating the need for workers to rely on tips for their basic income. Many comments suggest that the root of the problem is the sub-minimum \"tipped wage,\" which creates financial instability for service workers and places an unfair burden on customers to subsidize payroll. There is strong support for abolishing this wage structure and mandating that all workers receive a standard, livable hourly wage.</p>\n<p>Opinions on what should replace the current system vary. Some propose eliminating tipping entirely and incorporating a mandatory service charge into the bill, similar to practices in other countries. Others advocate for keeping tipping as a purely voluntary gesture of gratitude for exceptional service, but only in specific contexts like full-service restaurants. There is also a desire for the act of tipping to be less intrusive, with clear and easy \"no tip\" options on point-of-sale systems.</p>\n<p>While a small percentage of comments express full support for tipping as an incentive for good service, the overwhelming majority view the culture as out of control. The consensus is that a shift away from a tip-dependent model toward one with fair employer-paid wages would benefit both workers, by providing income stability, and consumers, by removing feelings of obligation and guilt.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 51s "}}
