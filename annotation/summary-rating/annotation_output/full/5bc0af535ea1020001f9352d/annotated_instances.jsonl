Many feel that tipping has become overly expected and intrusive, particularly with the proliferation of digital prompts in non-traditional settings like counter service or pickup orders. A common theme is the belief that employers should pay a living wage, shifting the financial burden from customers to businesses. There is notable support for eliminating tipping entirely or replacing it with a standardized service charge, while others advocate for making it truly optional and based solely on exceptional service. Some express that while they personally tip generously, they dislike the pressure and social obligation involved. A small percentage support the current system as an incentive for good service but still criticize the low base wages for service workers. The sentiment largely aligns with models seen in other countries where tipping is less prevalent, and service charges are integrated into pricing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 27s "}}
