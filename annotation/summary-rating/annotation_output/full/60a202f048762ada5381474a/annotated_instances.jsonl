Some report genuine mental-health and emotional support benefits.</li>\n<li>Creativity and making: Idea generation, image editing/enhancement, graphic design assistance, shirt and product designs, art experimentation, recipe ideas, sports and market analysis, and small-business support (pricing research, listings, policies).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Everyday convenience: Quicker answers than traditional search, home automation assistance, personalized recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concerns and downsides:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Privacy and data use: Worries about tracking, profiling, and data being used without consent.</li>\n<li>Job displacement and skill erosion: Anxiety about replacement in creative and knowledge work; fear of diminished originality and critical thinking; some educators report challenges teaching authenticity.</li>\n<li>Trust and accuracy: Need to fact-check due to occasional inaccuracy or biased sources; heightened vigilance about deepfakes, fake images/videos, and AI-generated content; some now distrust what they see online.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social impact: Perceived increase in social media addiction via algorithms; concerns that AI crowds out genuine human expression; environmental impact noted by a few.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usage patterns and attitudes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many treat AI as a versatile tool or \u201cassistant\u201d for work, school, and personal tasks; some say it\u2019s transformative, even indispensable.</li>\n<li>A notable group uses it lightly or sees it as an \u201cadvanced Google\u201d or list-maker, with little life change.</li>\n<li>A smaller contingent actively avoids AI on ethical grounds (e.g., \u201cAI is theft\u201d) or out of concern for dependence.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several call for more regulation and responsible use while welcoming continued innovation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Net takeaway: AI is broadly viewed as a powerful, time-saving companion that enhances research, writing, creativity, and daily life, but its gains are tempered by significant worries about privacy, authenticity, employment, and the need to preserve human judgment and originality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 59s "}}
