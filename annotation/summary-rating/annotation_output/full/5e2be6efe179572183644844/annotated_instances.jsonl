Some believe previous trade arrangements were unfair to the U.S. and that current policies will help stabilize the economy. A few respondents express confidence in the administration's business acumen and believe short-term challenges will lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>International Trade and Relations</strong>\nMultiple comments highlight concerns about deteriorating international relationships, particularly with China. Respondents worry that aggressive tariff policies could isolate the U.S. economically and damage its reputation as a reliable trading partner.

Many emphasize that tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers, as businesses pass along the additional costs. Several comments note that prices are already rising, contributing to inflation and making everyday living more expensive. There are worries that this particularly affects middle-class families and those already struggling financially. Some respondents fear the policies could trigger a recession or reduce overall economic output.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade and International Relations</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple comments highlight concerns about damaged international relationships, particularly with China. Several note that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading partners, potentially isolating the U.S. from global markets. There's skepticism about whether tariffs will successfully bring manufacturing back to America, with some pointing out that rebuilding domestic supply chains and factories is complex and time-consuming.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Tariff Policy</strong></p>\n<p>Supporters argue that tariffs could benefit the U.S. economy in the long term by addressing trade imbalances and generating revenue. Some believe previous trade arrangements were unfair to the U.S., and that collecting appropriate tariffs will help stabilize the economy. A few comments express confidence in the business-minded approach behind the policies and suggest that short-term difficulties may lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Several respondents question the effectiveness of implementation, with some noting that companies are finding ways to circumvent the tariffs. Others describe the policies as poorly conceived or primarily benefiting wealthy individuals rather than average citizens. There's concern about the \"capricious\" nature of the tariffs creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>Some comments acknowledge potential mixed effects, recognizing that certain domestic industries might benefit while others suffer. A few respondents suggest that while initial impacts may be negative, the long-term effects could be positive if the policies encourage domestic production and investment.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reveal substantial disagreement about the tariff policy's impact, with concerns about consumer costs, international relations, and economic stability competing against hopes for long-term domestic economic benefits and fairer trade relationships.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}
