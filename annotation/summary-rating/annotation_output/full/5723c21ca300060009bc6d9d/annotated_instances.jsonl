However, a significant portion emphasizes the necessity of rigorous vetting processes to ensure security and screen for criminal backgrounds. Concerns are also raised about economic impacts, resource allocation, and potential strain on public systems, with some advocating for limits to prioritize citizens' needs. A smaller contingent opposes accepting more refugees, citing current domestic challenges, overcrowding, or the belief that other nations should provide support. Overall, while humanitarian motives are prominent, practical considerations regarding implementation and safeguards are frequently highlighted.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
