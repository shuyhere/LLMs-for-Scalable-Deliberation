A significant percentage of contributors express frustration with the culture of tipping, describing it as over-expected and pervasive, even in transactions where no service is provided. Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" by point-of-sale systems that prominently request tips, creating an uncomfortable experience.</p>\n<p>A large majority of comments call for the elimination of the current system, arguing that the primary responsibility for paying workers should fall on employers, not customers. There is a widespread belief that businesses should be required to pay a livable or minimum wage, eliminating workers' heavy reliance on tips for their income. This is frequently contrasted with systems in places like Europe, where higher base pay makes tipping unnecessary.</p>\n<p>There is also notable support for making tipping truly voluntary and based solely on the quality of service received, rather than a social obligation. Some suggest specific improvements, such as integrating a service charge into the bill, making \"no tip\" options more accessible on payment systems, or moving from percentage-based to fixed-amount tips.</p>\n<p>While a small percentage of contributors support tipping as a way to show appreciation for good or exceptional service, this support is almost universally conditional on the service being provided first and the tip being a genuine choice, not an expectation. The overarching theme is a desire for a system that ensures fair compensation for workers without placing the burden and social pressure on the customer.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 47s "}}
