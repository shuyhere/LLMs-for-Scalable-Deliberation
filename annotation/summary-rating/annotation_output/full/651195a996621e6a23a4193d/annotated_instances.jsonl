Many commenters recognize that influencers provide value through entertainment, information, product recommendations, and advice. Several see them as a new form of media, capable of shaping trends and delivering news. The career is viewed as an enjoyable, convenient, and potentially lucrative way to make a living, with some comparing influencers to modern-day celebrities who may be more relatable.</p>\n<p>However, this positive view is accompanied by some notable criticisms and concerns. A primary concern is authenticity, with some finding influencers to be disingenuous and annoying. Another critique is the potential negative impact on culture, suggesting that influencer trends can lead to conformity and a lack of individual creativity. A desire for influencers to be responsible with their platform was also expressed. Even those who do not personally follow or relate to influencers often acknowledge their widespread impact and understand their role in the current social media landscape.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 6s "}}
