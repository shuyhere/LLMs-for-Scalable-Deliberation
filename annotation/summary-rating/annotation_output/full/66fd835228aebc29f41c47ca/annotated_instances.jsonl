A majority express frustration, viewing it as driven by corporate profit rather than genuine innovation. Critics frequently mention concerns about <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>, with many reporting that devices become unusable or unsupported within a few years, pressuring consumers to upgrade. This cycle is seen as financially burdensome and environmentally harmful due to increased electronic waste.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of commenters also highlight that the yearly updates often offer only <strong>incremental improvements</strong>, such as minor camera or performance boosts, which are not substantial enough to justify frequent upgrades or high costs. Many suggest that a slower update cycle, perhaps every two to three years, would be more sustainable and consumer-friendly.</p>\n<p>However, a minority appreciate the rapid pace for enabling better <strong>security, performance, and innovative features</strong>. They acknowledge that technological progress is exciting and that updates can enhance functionality and safety. Despite this, even some who see benefits express concern over the environmental impact and the pressure to constantly consume.</p>\n<p>Overall, the prevailing sentiment calls for a <strong>more balanced approach</strong> that prioritizes product longevity, repairability, and meaningful innovation over frequent, minor updates.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 16s "}}
