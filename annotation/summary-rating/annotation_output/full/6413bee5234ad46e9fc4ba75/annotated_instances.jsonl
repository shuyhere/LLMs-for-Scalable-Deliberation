They argue that people should not face death or suffering due to inability to afford medical treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>: Many comments highlight the economic advantages of universal healthcare. Respondents note that a government-based system would be more cost-effective and efficient than the current market-based approach. The mandatory participation would create economies of scale, ultimately reducing costs for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>: Several respondents point to other countries with successful universal healthcare systems, suggesting the United States is falling behind in caring for its citizens. Canada is specifically mentioned as a model, though with acknowledgment that improvements in speed of service would be needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>: Comments consistently criticize the existing healthcare system as expensive, inaccessible, and failing to produce good health outcomes despite high costs.

A common theme is the belief that the current market-based system fails to deliver adequate, affordable, and accessible care, leading to unmet medical needs and financial hardship for many individuals. </p>\n<p>Several commenters highlight the success of government-run systems in other countries, suggesting that the U.S. could benefit from adopting a similar model. They argue that universal healthcare would improve public health outcomes, reduce costs, and promote a more equitable society. There is also a recurring sentiment that people should not suffer or die due to an inability to afford care.</p>\n<p>Some commenters express concern about the current system\u2019s inefficiencies and stress that a government-led approach could streamline healthcare delivery and ensure broader coverage. While most support universal healthcare, a few emphasize the importance of maintaining choice, indicating a preference for a system that includes government provision but is not the only option.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments underscore a belief in the government\u2019s role in ensuring the well-being of its citizens through accessible and affordable healthcare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 34s "}}
