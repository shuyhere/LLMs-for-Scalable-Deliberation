The prevailing view is that healthcare should be a fundamental right for all citizens, not a luxury accessible only to those who can afford it.</p>\n<p>Many commenters expressed deep dissatisfaction with the current market-based system, citing its high costs, lack of access, and poor outcomes. They argue that the open market has failed to serve the public good and that people should not have to worry about finances when they need medical help.</p>\n<p>Several economic and social justifications were offered in support of a government-run system. Participants believe it would be more efficient and less expensive due to universal participation. Furthermore, ensuring a healthy population was seen as crucial for the nation's economic competitiveness and even national security. Commenters also pointed out that such a system would provide essential care to the most vulnerable, including the poor and unemployed.</p>\n<p>Comparisons to other countries were common, with the sentiment that the U.S. should follow the example of other nations that provide universal care. While the support was nearly unanimous, one commenter specified that they would support a government-provided plan as an option, but not if it were the only choice available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}
