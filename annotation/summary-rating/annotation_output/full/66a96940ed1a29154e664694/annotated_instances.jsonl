Many suggest that the system should be abolished in favor of employers paying a <strong>livable wage</strong>, which would eliminate the need for customers to subsidize employee pay. Others criticize the <strong>overextension of tipping culture</strong>, where tips are expected for minimal or no service (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping as a Reward for Service</strong><br />\n   A portion of the comments support tipping as a <strong>voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service</strong>. These individuals believe that tipping should be based on the <strong>quality of service</strong> and not be mandatory. They emphasize that tips should be given when a service exceeds expectations, not as a substitute for fair wages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Intrusive Tipping</strong><br />\n   Many commenters express frustration with <strong>forced tipping prompts</strong> on digital payment systems and the <strong>pressure to tip before receiving service</strong>.

A recurring theme is the belief that employers should be responsible for paying a fair, livable wage to their employees, eliminating the need for workers to rely on tips for their primary income. Many view tipping culture as having expanded beyond its original intent, with frustration directed at the expectation to tip for minimal or no service, such as at counter-service establishments or when picking up an order. This expansion is often attributed to the proliferation of digital payment systems that prominently feature and sometimes pressure customers for gratuity.</p>\n<p>There is strong support for making tipping genuinely voluntary and reserved as a reward for exceptional service, rather than a mandatory supplement to low wages. A significant portion of comments advocate for adopting a model similar to some European countries, where service charges are included in the bill or higher base wages are standard. While many contributors state they personally tip generously, they do so out of a sense of obligation to support underpaid workers rather than a belief in the system itself.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment is that the current system is broken, placing an unfair financial and social burden on customers while allowing businesses to avoid paying adequate wages. The desired improvements center on systemic change to ensure worker compensation is separated from customer tipping.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 5s "}}
