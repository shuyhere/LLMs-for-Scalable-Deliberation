Supporters often frame mandates as necessary when individual choices create risks for others and see government action as effective for early outbreak control.\n- A notable share supports enforcement conditionally\u2014emphasizing that measures should be time-limited (especially early in a pandemic) and that vaccines should be well-tested and proven effective.\n- Opposition centers on individual freedom and respect for differing beliefs, preference for encouragement over coercion, skepticism about the effectiveness of mandates, and concerns about vaccine safety and speed of development.\n- Approximate split: about 70% supportive (including conditional support) and about 30% opposed.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 53s "}}
