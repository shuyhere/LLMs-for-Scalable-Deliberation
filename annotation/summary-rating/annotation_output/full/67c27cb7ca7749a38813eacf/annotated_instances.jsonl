Many see clear benefits\u2014faster innovation, better performance, improved cameras, security updates, and the convenience of having powerful information tools at hand. However, concerns dominated: frequent releases make devices feel outdated quickly, create pressure to upgrade, and may encourage manufacturers to rush products rather than refine them. Several commenters cited perceived planned obsolescence, shorter software support compared to older computers, hardware reliability issues aligning with payment-plan timelines, and frustrating changes to charging standards that force additional accessory purchases. Rising prices, resource constraints, and tariffs were also noted as compounding factors.</p>\n<p>A strong preference emerged for longer-lasting devices and slower, more meaningful release cadences\u2014suggestions ranged from stretching major updates to roughly 2\u20133 years\u2014along with longer software support, better durability, and more consistency in accessories. Some expect the pace to moderate naturally as the technology matures and year-over-year gains become less noticeable.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 0s "}}
