Privacy concerns emerge as the primary reason for opposition, with people valuing the freedom to remain anonymous online. Many fear that requiring real identities could lead to negative consequences such as job loss due to political views, potential misuse of personal data by companies or government surveillance, and the loss of valuable anonymous forums like Reddit where people freely share information.</p>\n<p>Those who support real identity registration cite increased accountability and reduced harmful behaviors like cyberbullying and scams as key benefits. Supporters believe that attaching real names to online actions would encourage better behavior on social platforms.</p>\n<p>Several nuanced perspectives emerged, including conditional support depending on who implements the requirement (platform versus government), and recognition that while real identity systems have merit, they would eliminate important freedoms to speak anonymously. Practical concerns about enforcement were also raised, with some noting that verification would require intrusive documentation.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a strong preference for preserving online anonymity, with privacy and freedom of expression outweighing potential benefits of accountability through real identity requirements.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 34s "}}
