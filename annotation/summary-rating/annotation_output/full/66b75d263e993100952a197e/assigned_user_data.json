Many want to abolish the subminimum wage and raise base pay (often citing at least $15/hour) so tips become optional bonuses rather than necessities.\n- Preferred reforms:\n  - Replace tipping with service-included pricing or a fixed service charge (often around 10%), or fold compensation into menu prices\u2014citing European/Japanese models.\n  - Keep tipping strictly optional and tied to quality of service, given only after service is rendered.\n  - Limit tipping expectations to full-service restaurants; discourage or remove prompts for counter service, pickup, drive-thru, or low-touch transactions.\n  - Improve point-of-sale design: clear \u201cno tip\u201d option, no default pressure, and no pre-service prompts.\n  - Ensure minimum standards: some suggest minimum wages for all tipped workers, no taxes on tips, or employer matching a portion of tips.\n  - A few propose standardizing tipping (e.g., fixed-dollar tips rather than percentages) or making tips mandatory only if wages remain low.\n- Rationale: Current norms shift labor costs to consumers, create social pressure and guilt, strain budgets, and leave workers with uncertain incomes.
