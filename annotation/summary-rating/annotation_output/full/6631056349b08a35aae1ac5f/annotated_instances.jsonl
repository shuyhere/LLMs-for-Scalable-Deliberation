A significant portion of respondents opposes the requirement, citing concerns over privacy, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and risks to vulnerable individuals such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression and safety.</p>\n<p>Another substantial group supports real-name registration, believing it would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and bot activity. Proponents argue that linking online behavior to real identities would promote more responsible conduct and enhance platform safety and authenticity.</p>\n<p>Some express mixed or conditional views, suggesting that real-name verification might be useful for platform backend processes but should not necessarily be public, or that it should be optional rather than mandatory. A few remain neutral, acknowledging both the potential benefits for safety and the significant risks to privacy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
