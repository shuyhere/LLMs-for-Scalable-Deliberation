A central and widely shared belief is that the system allows employers to underpay their staff, shifting the responsibility of providing a livable wage from the business onto the customer.</p>\n<p>Consequently, a majority of commentators advocate for fundamental changes. The most common suggestion is to eliminate the tipping system entirely and require businesses to pay their employees a fair, livable wage. Many stated they would willingly accept higher menu prices if it meant workers were compensated fairly and the obligation to tip was removed. Other proposed alternatives include implementing a mandatory service charge or making tipping a truly optional gesture reserved only for exceptional service.</p>\n<p>There is a strong sentiment that tipping has expanded beyond its original scope, a phenomenon often referred to as \"tipping fatigue.\" Participants expressed annoyance at being prompted to tip for minimal or no service, such as at pickup counters or for basic transactions, often blaming the prevalence of tablet point-of-sale systems for making these encounters uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>While many feel obligated to tip due to workers' reliance on this income, there is a consensus that tips should be earned and directly reflect the quality of service received. Ultimately, the prevailing desire is for a system where employees receive fair compensation directly from their employers, and any gratuity from a customer is a voluntary and genuine reward for excellent service, rather than an obligation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
