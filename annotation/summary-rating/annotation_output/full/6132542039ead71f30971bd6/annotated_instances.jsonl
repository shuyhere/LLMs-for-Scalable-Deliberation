A central theme is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and that people should not suffer or die because they cannot afford care.</p>\n<p>Many commenters critique the current market-based system, describing it as prohibitively expensive with poor access and outcomes. They argue that a government system would be more efficient and affordable, particularly by ensuring everyone participates. The benefits cited include providing essential care for the poor, the unemployed, and those with chronic conditions.</p>\n<p>Several participants draw comparisons to other countries, noting that universal healthcare is a common and successful model elsewhere. One commenter suggested a system similar to Canada's but with improved speed. The idea of a healthy population was also linked to broader issues, with some viewing it as essential for the nation's economic competitiveness and even as a matter of national security.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some nuance exists. One participant specified that while they support a government-provided option, it should not be the <em>only</em> choice available to citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
