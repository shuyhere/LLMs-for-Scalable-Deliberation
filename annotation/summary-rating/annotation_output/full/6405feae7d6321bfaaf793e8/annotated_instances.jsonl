Supporters prioritize curbing harm and inauthentic behavior, while opponents emphasize protecting users\u2014especially vulnerable groups\u2014from real-world risks and data misuse. Many favor flexible, privacy-preserving verification options over a blanket requirement.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 15s "}}
