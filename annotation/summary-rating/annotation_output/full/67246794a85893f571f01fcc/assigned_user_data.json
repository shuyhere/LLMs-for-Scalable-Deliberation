The primary argument is that linking real identities to online activity would increase accountability, leading to a reduction in harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Several supporters feel that the anonymity of the internet has enabled toxic behavior, and that real-name registration would compel people to act more civilly.
