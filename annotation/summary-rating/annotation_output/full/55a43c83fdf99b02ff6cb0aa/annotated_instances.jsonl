This support is rooted in several core beliefs that were expressed repeatedly.</p>\n<p>The most prominent argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many feel it is morally wrong for individuals to suffer, go into debt, or die because they cannot afford medical care. This perspective is often linked to the idea that it is a core responsibility of a government to care for the well-being of its citizens.</p>\n<p>Another major theme is the comparison to other developed nations. Commenters frequently pointed out that the U.S. is an outlier among wealthy countries for not having a universal healthcare system, and they see the success of these systems elsewhere as a model to follow.</p>\n<p>Economic concerns are also a significant driver of support. Many participants described the current system as \"insanely expensive,\" leading to medical debt and bankruptcy. They believe a government-provided system would be more efficient, reduce financial burdens on individuals, and improve the nation's economic health by ensuring a healthier workforce. Proponents also argued that universal access to preventative care would lead to better long-term health outcomes and catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters expressed conditional support. Their approval depends on specific factors, such as the preservation of private insurance choices alongside a public option, ensuring that care can be delivered in a timely manner without long waits, and clearly defining what \"basic\" care entails.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a minority of participants oppose a government-run system. Their primary arguments center on the belief that government is inefficient, wasteful, and would provide a lower quality of care than the private sector. They also raised concerns about the high cost to taxpayers, the fairness of the system, and a desire to reduce dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 37s "}}
