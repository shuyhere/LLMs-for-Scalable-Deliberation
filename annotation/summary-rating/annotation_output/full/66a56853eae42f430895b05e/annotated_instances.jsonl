Many express a belief that offering refuge is a fundamental responsibility and aligns with the nation\u2019s historical identity.</p>\n<p>A prevalent theme among both supporters and opponents is the call for robust vetting processes. Many commenters insist on thorough background checks to ensure national security and to exclude criminals or economic migrants who do not qualify as refugees.</p>\n<p>Concerns about domestic capacity are also prominent. A significant number of commenters express the view that while helping refugees is important, the government must prioritize its current citizens. They worry about the strain on public resources, the economy, and social systems, arguing that assistance should not come at the expense of citizens' quality of life.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of commenters are opposed to accepting more refugees. Their primary objections center on the belief that the country cannot afford it, that it places an excessive burden on national systems, and that refugees should seek asylum in neighboring countries first rather than traveling long distances.</p>\n<p>In summary, while humanitarian compassion forms a strong basis for support, this is frequently tempered by pragmatic concerns over security, integration, and ensuring domestic stability is not compromised.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
