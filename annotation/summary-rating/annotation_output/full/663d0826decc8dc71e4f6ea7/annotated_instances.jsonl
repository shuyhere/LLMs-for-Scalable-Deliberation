Common complaints include being asked to tip for counter service, pickup orders, and minimal-service transactions. Several people describe feeling pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping through awkward point-of-sale interfaces that make it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<h3>The Wage Issue</h3>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Many respondents believe the fundamental problem is that employers use tipping as an excuse to pay workers below a living wage, particularly in the restaurant industry where servers may earn as little as $2.13 per hour. There's widespread agreement that workers should receive fair base wages rather than depending on tips for survival.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on Reform</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improving the system is eliminating tipping altogether and requiring employers to pay living wages. Some propose adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices. Others suggest compromises such as making tipping truly optional, limiting tip requests to full-service situations, or implementing flat service charges instead of percentage-based tips.</p>\n<h3>Support for Tipping</h3>\n<p>Despite the criticism, some respondents strongly support tipping, viewing it as a way to reward excellent service and help workers earn more than minimum wage. These supporters often emphasize tipping generously (with some mentioning 20-30% as appropriate) and see it as an incentive for employees to provide better service.</p>\n<h3>Middle Ground Perspectives</h3>\n<p>Many commenters occupy a middle position - they don't object to tipping for genuine service (such as table service or delivery) but resist the expansion of tipping to every transaction. They distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus forced, and many express a desire for tipping to return to being a genuine expression of gratitude rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment suggests that while people want service workers to be fairly compensated, the current tipping system is viewed as problematic, with most preferring either significant reform or complete elimination in favor of fair wages.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}

A significant percentage of participants believe the fundamental solution is to abolish tipping entirely and require employers to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, even if it means higher menu prices.</p>\n<p>Another major theme is \"tipping fatigue,\" driven by the expansion of tipping requests to nearly every transaction, including counter service, pickup orders, and situations with minimal or no direct service. Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" by tablet point-of-sale systems that often default to tip options and make it awkward to decline.</p>\n<p>There is a strong consensus that tips should be a voluntary reward for excellent service, not a mandatory or expected charge. Many feel the system has lost its original purpose, with people feeling obligated to tip for even subpar service.</p>\n<p>While the desire to abolish the system is the most common suggestion, other proposed improvements include:\n*   Adopting systems used in other countries, such as a built-in service charge.\n*   Limiting tipping requests to only full-service environments like sit-down restaurants.\n*   Making the \"no tip\" option on payment screens more accessible and less intrusive.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of participants expressed support for tipping, viewing it as a necessary way to supplement workers' low incomes, a good deed, or a great incentive for employees to provide excellent service. Some of these individuals believe the problem is not the system itself but customers who do not tip appropriately.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
