Many participants argued that the fundamental solution is to require businesses to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, which would make tipping unnecessary or truly optional, similar to models seen in Europe.</p>\n<p>Another major point of frustration is the expansion of tipping requests into transactions that traditionally did not involve them, such as take-out orders or counter service. This \"tipping creep\" is often attributed to tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip by default, creating social pressure and discomfort for customers.</p>\n<p>While the desire to eliminate the system is common, there is a consistent belief that when tipping does occur, it should be a voluntary reward for excellent or above-and-beyond service, not a mandatory obligation. Some feel pressured to tip for poor service or before service is even rendered.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of participants expressed support for tipping as a \"good deed\" or a necessary way to supplement the low income of service workers. Alternative suggestions for improvement included replacing tips with a mandatory service charge, changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts, or redesigning payment systems to make declining a tip less awkward.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 35s "}}
