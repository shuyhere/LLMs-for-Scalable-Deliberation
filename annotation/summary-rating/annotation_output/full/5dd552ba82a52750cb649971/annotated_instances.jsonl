The primary reasons for this opposition centered on the importance of privacy and the freedom to be anonymous online. Several participants expressed concerns that such a requirement would be intrusive to enforce and could lead to real-world consequences, such as job loss, for expressing personal or political beliefs. There was also significant apprehension about companies creating databases of personal information that could be misused or sold to governments.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who supported the idea did so on the grounds of accountability. They argued that linking real identities to online activity would improve user behavior, leading to a reduction in cyberbullying and scams.</p>\n<p>Some comments offered a more nuanced perspective. One participant's support was conditional, stating it might be acceptable if required by the platform itself, but not by the government. Another acknowledged the merits of accountability but ultimately valued the freedom to speak anonymously.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
