Approximately two-thirds of the comments anticipate adverse effects, primarily highlighting increased consumer prices, negative impacts on small businesses, strained international relations, and potential economic instability. Many express concern that tariffs function as a hidden tax on consumers, leading to inflation and reduced purchasing power, disproportionately affecting middle and lower-income households.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion, roughly one-third, supports the policy, believing it will benefit the U.S. economy in the long term.
