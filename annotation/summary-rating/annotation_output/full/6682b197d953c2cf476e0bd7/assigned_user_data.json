The remaining participants express opposition or qualified support with significant reservations.</p>\n<h3>Key Arguments in Favor</h3>\n<p><strong>Healthcare as a Human Right</strong>: The most prevalent argument centers on healthcare being a fundamental human right rather than a privilege. Participants emphasize that access to medical care should not depend on income, employment status, or socioeconomic class. Many express that in a wealthy nation, no one should have to choose between healthcare and basic necessities like food or shelter.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>: Participants frequently reference other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, noting that the United States stands virtually alone among first-world countries in not offering this benefit. This comparison leads many to question why America, despite its wealth and high healthcare spending, cannot provide what other nations manage effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and Social Benefits</strong>: Supporters argue that universal coverage would lead to better health outcomes through preventive care, reduce medical debt and bankruptcies, and ultimately strengthen the economy by creating a healthier, more productive workforce. Several participants view this as a national security issue, arguing that a healthy population is essential for global economic competitiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>: Many highlight the inadequacies of the current system, including high costs, limited access, poor outcomes despite high spending, and the profit-driven nature of private insurance companies that may prioritize profits over patient care.</p>\n<h3>Arguments Against or Concerns</h3>\n<p><strong>Government Inefficiency</strong>: Opponents express concern that government-run healthcare would be inefficient, wasteful, and poorly managed, potentially lowering the quality of care. Some believe the private sector is better equipped to provide quality healthcare services.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost and Dependency Concerns</strong>: Critics worry about taxpayer burden and increasing government dependency.
