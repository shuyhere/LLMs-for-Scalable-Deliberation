Commenters frequently cite the moral obligation to help innocent people fleeing life-threatening persecution and war, often highlighting that these individuals did not choose their circumstances and deserve safety and an opportunity for a better life.</p>\n<p>Another common theme is conditional support, where agreement is coupled with calls for stricter vetting processes to ensure security and thorough integration programs to help refugees adapt to their new society.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of comments opposes accepting more refugees, primarily due to economic concerns. These perspectives argue that national resources are finite and should be prioritized for existing citizens before being extended to others. Commenters express worry about the strain on public systems, government expenditure, and the potential negative impact on the quality of life for current residents.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation highlights a tension between a compassionate, humanitarian impulse to provide refuge and pragmatic concerns about national capacity, economic stability, and the well-being of current citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
