Some note a moral responsibility when U.S. foreign policy contributes to crises and see potential benefits such as cultural diversity and grateful, contributing new residents.\n- Conditional support is common: Many emphasize rigorous vetting and background checks, clear definitions distinguishing refugees from economic migrants, excluding individuals with criminal histories, and setting reasonable intake limits to protect quality of life and ensure public safety.\n- Resource and capacity concerns: A significant minority oppose or are hesitant, arguing the U.S. should prioritize citizens first, citing national debt, housing and social service strain, crowded cities, and perceived unfairness in aid distribution. Some worry vetting can\u2019t keep pace with arrivals or that refugees should seek protection in nearer countries.\n- Implementation ideas: Proposals include distributing newcomers to less-populated or rural areas, using temporary reception centers with skills training, providing integration education and civics orientation, monitoring economic impacts and adjusting intake accordingly, and prioritizing particularly vulnerable groups (e.g., those connected to U.S. actions or from under-supported regions).\n- Mixed views: Several express ambivalence\u2014wanting to help but concerned about security, costs, and competition for limited resources.\n- Core values in tension: Compassion, human dignity, and America\u2019s identity as a haven versus prudence, fiscal responsibility, and ensuring citizens\u2019 needs are met.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 57s "}}
