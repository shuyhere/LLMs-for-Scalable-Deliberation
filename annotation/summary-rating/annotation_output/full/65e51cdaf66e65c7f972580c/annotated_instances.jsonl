A significant portion of the feedback expresses opposition to the idea, emphasizing concerns about privacy, freedom of expression, and the potential misuse of personal data. Many argue that anonymity is a valuable tool for free speech, particularly in contexts where individuals may face real-world consequences for their online views. Some also raise concerns about government overreach and the risks associated with centralized databases of personal information.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller share of the comments support the idea, primarily citing increased accountability and the potential to reduce harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying and scams. A few commenters acknowledge both sides of the issue, recognizing the benefits of real-name systems while also valuing the importance of anonymity in certain contexts.</p>\n<p>There is also some nuance in the responses, with a few commenters indicating that their stance depends on who enforces the requirement\u2014supporting it if done by platforms but opposing it if mandated by the government.</p>\n<p>Overall, the majority of the comments lean toward opposing mandatory real-name registration, with a strong emphasis on the protection of privacy and online anonymity as essential components of a free and open internet.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 15s "}}
