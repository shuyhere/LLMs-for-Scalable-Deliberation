It is frequently described as a powerful assistant that streamlines daily routines and professional tasks, such as writing emails, summarizing documents, planning events, and conducting research. Many see it as an evolution of search engines, providing faster, more direct answers and making it easier to learn new skills and understand complex subjects.</p>\n<p>Beyond productivity, AI is seen as a catalyst for creativity and personal growth. Individuals use it to generate ideas, create art, edit photos, and improve their writing.

A recurring theme is the erosion of trust and authenticity, with many expressing increased vigilance and skepticism toward online content, fearing the spread of misinformation and \"deepfakes.\" Privacy is another major issue, with respondents worrying about their personal data being collected and used without their knowledge.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, many express anxiety about the future, particularly regarding job security and the possibility of their skills becoming obsolete.
