Many argued that education is the foundation of a prosperous society and that reducing its funding threatens the country's future, innovation, and long-term competitiveness. These participants voiced concerns that the cuts would harm students by limiting opportunities, particularly for those from lower-income backgrounds, and negatively impact educators and researchers.
