A small subset supports quarantine but not mandatory vaccination.\n- Approximate split: About 57% express support (often conditional), around 37% oppose, and roughly 7% back quarantine but reject vaccine mandates.\n- Reasons for support: Protecting public health and preventing spread (herd immunity), lessons from recent pandemics, the view that collective safety can outweigh individual preferences during crises, and the belief that early, temporary enforcement is justified. Several emphasize conditions such as demonstrated disease severity, clear evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety, and strong public education. A few favor penalties for noncompliance.\n- Reasons for opposition: Emphasis on individual rights and bodily autonomy, distrust of government competence or transparency during COVID-19, concerns about vaccine safety or insufficient long-term data, and skepticism about the effectiveness or legitimacy of mandates. Some prefer strong encouragement and education over coercion.\n- Middle ground and nuances: Support for time-limited measures early in an outbreak, acceptance of quarantine but not vaccine mandates, and calls for robust public communication to build trust. The central tension is the trade-off between civil liberties and collective health protection.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 23s "}}
