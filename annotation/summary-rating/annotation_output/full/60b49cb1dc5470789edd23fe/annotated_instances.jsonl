Many emphasized that education serves as the foundation for all professions and societal progress, warning that reduced funding would lead to long-term negative consequences.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments highlighted concerns about the impact on multiple groups: students who cannot afford education, adults seeking to further their education, and researchers whose work could lead to important innovations. Several respondents specifically mentioned the potential loss of medical and scientific research capabilities, with some warning that talented researchers might leave for other countries with better funding.</p>\n<p>Many characterized the funding cuts as \"short-sighted,\" \"foolish,\" or \"moronic,\" arguing that while they might save money in the short term, they would ultimately weaken America's competitiveness and innovation capacity. Some respondents connected education funding to broader societal issues, suggesting that a less educated population would be more vulnerable to manipulation and that the cuts would particularly harm disadvantaged communities.</p>\n<p>A small minority offered different perspectives. Some suggested there might be justification for cuts due to perceived political bias in academic institutions, though even these responses often acknowledged potential negative effects on independent thinking. A few respondents indicated they lacked sufficient information to form an opinion or believed that education needed reform, suggesting that cuts might lead to positive changes.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflected deep concern about the potential consequences of academic funding cuts, with most viewing education investment as crucial for individual opportunity, scientific advancement, and national prosperity. The primary themes centered on fears about diminished educational quality, lost research opportunities, reduced social mobility, and long-term damage to America's global standing in education and innovation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
