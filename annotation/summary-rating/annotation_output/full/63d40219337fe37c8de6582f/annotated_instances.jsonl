They argue education is foundational to economic growth and social mobility, and warn that reduced funding would shrink opportunities, weaken public schools and adult learning, slow innovation and medical research, and risk a brain drain to other countries. Many frame the move as politically motivated, fearing it undermines independent thought, institutional trust, and democratic norms.</p>\n<p>A smaller share express conditional or supportive views, citing concerns about ideological bias in academia, wasteful spending, or the need for reform; they emphasize that any reductions should come with alternative solutions. A few are neutral or unsure due to limited information.
