A common theme is the concern that tipping has become overly expected or even mandatory, especially in situations where direct service is minimal or absent. Many commenters criticize the system for placing the burden of fair wages on consumers rather than on employers.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback suggests that <strong>tipping should be eliminated</strong> in favor of a model where <strong>employees are paid a living wage</strong> by their employers. This reflects a belief that the current system allows businesses to underpay workers, forcing them to rely on customer generosity to make ends meet. Some propose replacing tipping with a <strong>flat service charge</strong>, such as a 10% fee added to the bill, to simplify the process and ensure fair compensation for workers.</p>\n<p>For those who support tipping, the general consensus is that it should be <strong>optional, based on service quality, and not forced</strong>. Several commenters expressed frustration with <strong>digital prompts</strong> and <strong>default tipping options</strong> that pressure customers to tip even when no service is provided. There is also a desire for a return to a time when tipping was more of a personal gesture and less of a social obligation.</p>\n<p>Some commenters advocate for <strong>reforms to the tipping system</strong>, such as standardizing tip amounts, tying tips to service levels, or making tipping more transparent and voluntary. Others suggest <strong>cultural changes</strong>, such as adopting systems from other countries where tipping is less prevalent or not expected at all.</p>\n<p>In summary, the tipping system is viewed by many as flawed, with calls for reform centered around <strong>fair wages, reduced consumer pressure, and a shift away from a culture of expectation</strong>. While there is support for tipping in cases of good service, the overall sentiment is that the system should be restructured or eliminated in favor of more equitable and predictable compensation models for service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}
