Roughly three-quarters express clear support, about one-fifth support with conditions (e.g., maintain choice and ensure timely care), and under 10% oppose.\n- Pro-support themes:\n  - Healthcare viewed as a human right and a core government responsibility to promote public welfare, safety, and national competitiveness.\n  - Affordability and access: current costs are seen as prohibitive, leading to debt, forgoing care, and inequity; many cite unemployment or low income as barriers.\n  - System performance: belief that universal coverage would be cheaper overall, more efficient with a larger risk pool, and less driven by for\u2011profit motives that can restrict care.\n  - International comparisons: frequent references to other developed countries (e.g., Canada) where universal systems are perceived to work; the U.S. is seen as lagging.\n  - Health outcomes and equity: earlier diagnosis (including chronic/autoimmune issues), inclusion of basic and even dental needs, and ensuring no one is denied care due to ability to pay.\n- Conditional support:\n  - Preference for a public option alongside private plans rather than a single mandatory system.\n  - Emphasis on basic coverage rather than extensive benefits; avoid intrusive monitoring/bureaucracy.\n  - Strong concern for timely access and maintaining quality; some note taxpayers should see clear benefit.\n- Opposition:\n  - Skepticism that government can run healthcare effectively; concerns about quality, efficiency, and fostering dependency on government.</p>\n<p>In sum, comments converge on making basic healthcare universally accessible and affordable, with many favoring a public option and safeguards for timeliness and quality. A small minority rejects government provision on efficiency and ideological grounds.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
