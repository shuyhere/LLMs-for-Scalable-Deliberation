They argue that mandates for vaccination and quarantine are the most effective tools to prevent the spread of disease and protect the wider community, particularly during the uncertain early stages of a pandemic. Some supporters also express that individual choices can have negative consequences for everyone, making government intervention necessary for the greater good.</p>\n<p>Conversely, opposition to enforcement centers on concerns about individual freedom and medical safety. Some opponents believe mandates are ineffective because people will ultimately do what they want. Others express specific concerns about the safety of rapidly developed vaccines, citing potential adverse health effects, and argue that personal beliefs should be respected.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation highlights a fundamental tension between the principles of public health protection and individual bodily autonomy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}
