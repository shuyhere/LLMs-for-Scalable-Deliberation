Many point to international examples, argue it would reduce medical debt and bankruptcies, improve preventive care and outcomes, and enhance economic productivity and even national security. Several favor using Medicare as a foundation and including dental and vision.</li>\n<li>Conditional/qualified support: About 10% back a public option or baseline coverage with safeguards\u2014maintaining choice of private plans, ensuring timely access, focusing coverage on citizens or those who can\u2019t afford private insurance, or limiting it to \u201cbasic\u201d services. Some want an opt-out or a universal fallback for people who lose coverage due to life events.</li>\n<li>Opposition: Around 10% oppose government-provided basic insurance, arguing government inefficiency, higher taxes, trade-offs with other public services, reduced quality, longer wait times, increased dependency, and privacy/monitoring concerns. Some emphasize preserving a private-sector-led system and individual choice.</li>\n<li>Recurring themes and implementation ideas: Emphasize preventive care to lower long-term costs; ensure administrative simplicity and reduce bureaucracy; protect timely access and quality; allow coexistence with private plans; consider funding via taxes with visible benefits for taxpayers; clarify scope (e.g., \u201cbare minimum\u201d baseline); address coverage continuity during job loss; and ensure policies don\u2019t leave people falling through the cracks.</li>\n<li>Sentiment about the status quo: Many describe current costs as prohibitive, the system as profit-driven, and outcomes as poor relative to spending. Personal stories highlight barriers, delays in public program approvals, and fear of medical debt.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
