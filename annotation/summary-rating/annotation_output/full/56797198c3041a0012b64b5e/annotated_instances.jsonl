Around 70% argue it is short-sighted and harmful, emphasizing that education underpins societal and economic health. Common concerns include reduced access and fairness for both children and adult learners, diminished quality and safety in education, and especially weakened research capacity leading to fewer innovations, loss of competitiveness, and potential brain drain to other countries. About 20% offer mixed or conditional views, acknowledging concerns about perceived ideological bias in academia or expressing trust that alternatives might exist, but still warning that cuts without viable replacements would degrade outcomes. Roughly 10% are unsure and request more details before forming an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}
