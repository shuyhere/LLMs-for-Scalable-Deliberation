This expansion of tipping prompts is frequently described as uncomfortable, intrusive, and \"out of hand.\"</p>\n<p>The predominant sentiment is that the core issue lies with employers not paying a living wage, thereby shifting the responsibility of worker compensation onto the customer through tips. A significant percentage of commentators advocate for the abolition of the current system in favor of one where service workers receive a fair, livable base wage from their employers, making tipping truly optional and a genuine reward for exceptional service rather than a mandatory subsidy for low wages.</p>\n<p>There is strong support for limiting tipping to traditional, full-service contexts, such as sit-down restaurants where a server provides direct and sustained service. Many suggest that a service charge could be a more transparent alternative, as practiced in some other countries.</p>\n<p>While a smaller portion of commentators fully support tipping as an incentive for excellent service, even among these supporters, many express a desire for workers to have a more stable base income. Overall, the collective opinion calls for a systemic shift away from customer-subsidized wages and toward employer responsibility for fair pay, with gratuities returning to their original purpose as a voluntary bonus for outstanding service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
