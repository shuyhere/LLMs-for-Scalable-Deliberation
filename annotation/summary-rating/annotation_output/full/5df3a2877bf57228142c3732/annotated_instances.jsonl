The primary concerns cited are price increases for consumers, rising inflation, and a higher cost of everyday living. Other negative points raised include potential harm to small businesses, damage to international relationships, and the belief that the policy benefits the wealthy without creating a significant number of jobs.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of commentators see the policy as having a positive effect. Proponents argue that it corrects an unfair global trade system and that the revenue generated will help stabilize the economy and the national budget. Some express confidence that the policy will provide long-term benefits and help lift American workers out of poverty, even if the immediate effects are not yet clear.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
