A smaller share appreciates the pace of innovation and security improvements, and a minority is strongly positive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perceived benefits:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Continual innovation brings better performance, cameras, storage/RAM, security patches, and new apps/AI features.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smartphones enable fast access to information and productivity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Diminishing returns: Year-over-year changes feel incremental; meaningful differences often appear only after 2\u20133 generations.</li>\n<li>Consumer pressure and cost: Frequent releases create upgrade pressure, higher spending, and frustration with rising prices; charger/accessory changes add costs.</li>\n<li>Planned obsolescence and support cutoffs: Older devices lose software support or degrade in usability, pushing premature replacements.</li>\n<li>Software quality and privacy: Rapid updates can introduce bugs and instability; some worry about intrusive data collection.</li>\n<li>Environmental impact: E-waste, resource use, and poor repairability are major worries; many label the cycle wasteful.</li>\n<li>Repairability and longevity: Devices are hard to fix, with limited parts and high repair costs.</li>\n<li>Social effects: Concerns about exclusion for those who can\u2019t keep up and potential negative impacts on youth.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few note broader factors like tariffs and supply chain costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferences and suggestions:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Slow the hardware cadence (e.g., major releases every 2\u20133 years) while maintaining frequent security patches.</li>\n<li>Prioritize longer software support, stability, and thorough testing over rapid feature pushes.</li>\n<li>Improve longevity and repairability (right-to-repair, modular parts) and standardize chargers/accessories.</li>\n<li>Be transparent about incremental upgrades; emphasize that recent models remain capable.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Focus on sustainability commitments and fairer pricing; shift more innovation to software where possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bottom line: Roughly three-quarters express negative or cautious views, citing waste, costs, and marginal gains.
