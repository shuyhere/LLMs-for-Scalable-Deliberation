Many distrust social media companies and fear potential misuse of personal data, including identity theft, unauthorized data sales, or increased vulnerability in cases of security breaches. Some also worry that real-name policies could suppress free expression and disproportionately harm marginalized voices.</p>\n<p>Supporters believe real-name registration would foster greater accountability, reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, misinformation, and impersonation, and help create a more authentic and safer online environment. They argue that linking online actions to real identities could deter malicious activity and aid in addressing issues such as bot accounts and harmful speech.</p>\n<p>A minority of commenters suggest a middle ground, such as allowing pseudonymous public profiles while keeping real identities verified but private, or implementing optional verification systems that balance safety with privacy. Concerns about enforceability, risks of data exposure, and the potential for such policies to be circumvented are also noted.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}
