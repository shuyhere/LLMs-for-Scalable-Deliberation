There's widespread agreement that workers should receive fair base wages rather than depending on tips for survival.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Reform</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improving the system is eliminating tipping altogether and requiring employers to pay living wages. Some propose adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included in prices. Others suggest compromises such as making tipping truly optional, limiting tip requests to full-service situations, or implementing flat service charges instead of percentage-based tips.</p>\n<h6>Support for Tipping</h6>\n<p>Despite the criticism, some respondents strongly support tipping, viewing it as a way to reward excellent service and help workers earn more than minimum wage. These supporters often emphasize tipping generously (with some mentioning 20-30% as appropriate) and see it as an incentive for employees to provide better service.</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Many commenters occupy a middle position - they don't object to tipping for genuine service (such as table service or delivery) but resist the expansion of tipping to every transaction.
