Many feel it\u2019s overextended, coercive, and shifts labor costs from employers to customers.</li>\n<li>Core principle most agree on: Tipping should be voluntary, tied to the quality of service, and not expected for minimal or no service.</li>\n<li>Who should be tipped: Broad support for tipping in full-service restaurants and for delivery drivers; frequent pushback against tipping for counter service, pickup orders, coffee shops, and simple transactions.</li>\n<li>Pay and policy changes favored:</li>\n<li>Require employers to pay a living wage (at least full minimum wage for tipped workers) so income doesn\u2019t hinge on tips.</li>\n<li>Reduce or remove tipping prompts, especially pre-service prompts and intrusive tablet screens; add an easy \u201cno tip\u201d option; only prompt where real service is provided.</li>\n<li>Replace tipping with built-in service charges or higher menu prices so workers are paid fairly without relying on tips. Some suggest modest service fees (around 10%) with optional additional tips.</li>\n<li>Views on keeping tipping: A minority strongly supports tipping as an incentive for great service and regularly tips generously; a smaller subset endorses higher standard rates (e.g., 20\u201330%) or even mandatory tipping unless wages meet a specific floor.</li>\n<li>Concerns raised:</li>\n<li>Social pressure and \u201cguilt tipping,\u201d especially via POS tablets.</li>\n<li>Unpredictable income for workers and confusion for customers about when/how much to tip.</li>\n<li>Expansion of tipping requests to contexts that don\u2019t involve meaningful service.</li>\n<li>Less common or mixed ideas:</li>\n<li>Make tipping fixed amounts rather than percentages for small bills.</li>\n<li>Exempt tips from taxation or have employers match a portion of tips.</li>\n<li>Provide small rewards for tipping (thank-you notes, coupons).</li>\n<li>Establish clearer standards for who is tipped and when.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: Most want to curb tip creep, ensure workers earn a stable, livable wage from employers, and reserve tipping as a discretionary bonus for clear, high-quality service\u2014often limited to traditional, full-service contexts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}
