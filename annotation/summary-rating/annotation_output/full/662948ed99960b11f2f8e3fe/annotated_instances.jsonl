Approximately 60% of respondents oppose such a requirement, primarily citing concerns over privacy, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and safety risks such as doxxing, stalking, or harm to marginalized groups. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression and protection, especially for vulnerable individuals.</p>\n<p>Conversely, around 40% support the idea, emphasizing benefits like increased accountability, reduced cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and impersonation. Supporters believe real-name registration could foster a safer, more authentic online environment and help combat harmful behavior.</p>\n<p>A small percentage express ambivalence, acknowledging both advantages and drawbacks, and some suggest compromises, such as optional real-name use or verification without public disclosure. Key themes include balancing safety with privacy, distrust of tech companies, and the importance of protecting free speech and individual rights.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
