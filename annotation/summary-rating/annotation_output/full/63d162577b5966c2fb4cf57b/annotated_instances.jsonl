Roughly 70% view the tariff policy as harmful, about 20% see it as beneficial, and around 10% offer mixed or uncertain views.</p>\n<p>Key negative themes:\n- Higher prices and inflation: Many expect businesses to pass tariff costs to consumers, squeezing household budgets and especially hurting lower- and middle-income families.\n- Pressure on small businesses: Several cite rising input costs, delays, and trade frictions that strain smaller firms.\n- Limited reshoring and investment uncertainty: Skepticism that tariffs will bring manufacturing back given dissolved supply chains; firms may delay investment amid policy unpredictability.\n- International fallout: Concerns about damaged relations (notably with China), retaliation, reduced free trade, and a perception of U.S. \u201cbullying,\u201d potentially isolating the U.S. and raising recession risks.</p>\n<p>Key positive themes:\n- Long-term protection and competitiveness: Supporters think tariffs can shield strategic industries, make U.S.-made goods more competitive, and encourage \u201cbuy American.\u201d\n- Fiscal and bargaining leverage: Some believe tariff revenue and tougher stances can stabilize the budget and secure better trade deals over time.\n- Leveling the playing field: A view that other countries have taken advantage of the U.S., and tariffs correct imbalances, even if short-term costs rise.</p>\n<p>Mixed/conditional views:\n- Short-term pain, possible long-term gain if policies are consistent, targeted, and paired with broader economic strategy.\n- Some perceive limited real impact so far due to company workarounds.\n- A few cite studies projecting longer-run economic losses, underscoring uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Bottom line:\nMost commenters anticipate near-term negative effects\u2014especially higher consumer prices and strain on small businesses\u2014with worries about trade retaliation and investment uncertainty. A minority expects potential long-run benefits for domestic industry and bargaining power if the policy is sustained, targeted, and complemented by broader measures.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
