Supporters also highlight the importance of showing compassion, promoting global solidarity, and providing safety to those in life-threatening situations.</p>\n<p>Among those in favor, several emphasize the need for thorough vetting processes, clear qualifications for refugee status, and integration support to ensure that both refugees and citizens are treated fairly. Concerns are raised about resource allocation, economic impact, and the need to address domestic issues before taking in more refugees. A smaller portion of the comments express opposition, often citing the burden on existing systems, the presence of undocumented immigrants, or the belief that the U.S. should focus on its own citizens first.</p>\n<p>Some comments express ambivalence or neutrality, acknowledging the need to help but also expressing uncertainty about the capacity or consequences of doing so.
