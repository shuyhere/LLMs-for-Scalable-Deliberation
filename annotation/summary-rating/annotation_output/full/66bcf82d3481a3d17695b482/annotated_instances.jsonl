Many argue that reducing funding undermines the quality of education, limits opportunities for students and researchers, and hampers innovation and long-term competitiveness. Concerns are also raised about the potential for brain drain, where talented researchers might seek opportunities elsewhere, and the negative impact on vulnerable students who rely on financial support to afford education. A few comments suggest that while there may be some justification for reducing funding due to political concerns, such cuts risk stifling independent thinking.
