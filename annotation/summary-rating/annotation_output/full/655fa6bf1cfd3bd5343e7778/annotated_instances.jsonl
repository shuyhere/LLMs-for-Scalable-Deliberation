Concerns center on immediate price increases for consumers, with many noting that tariffs function as a de facto tax passed on through higher costs for imported goods, disproportionately affecting lower and middle-income households. Small businesses frequently report adverse effects, citing disrupted supply chains and increased operational expenses.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the short-term versus long-term impact dichotomy. Critics emphasize immediate economic strain, including inflation, reduced consumer spending, and potential job losses, while proponents argue that tariffs could eventually strengthen domestic industries, reduce trade deficits, and boost national revenue. Some supporters believe the policy will encourage buying American products and force fairer trade agreements, though this view is less common.</p>\n<p>International relations are another point of contention, with several comments warning that tariffs damage diplomatic ties, encourage retaliation from other nations, and undermine the U.S.'s role as a reliable trading partner. Uncertainty and instability in policy enforcement are also cited as harmful to business investment and planning.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment skews negative, focusing on the burdens placed on everyday Americans and the broader economic risks, while a minority holds out hope for strategic, long-term gains.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
