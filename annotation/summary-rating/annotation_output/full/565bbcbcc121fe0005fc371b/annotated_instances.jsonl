A smaller minority see potential benefits, especially over the long term, and a few describe mixed or limited effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main concerns (negative impacts):</p>\n</li>\n<li>Higher consumer prices and inflation, with costs passed on from businesses to buyers; regressive effects that squeeze low- and middle-income households and small businesses.</li>\n<li>Reduced consumer spending and purchasing power, business closures or cutbacks, and fears of recession.</li>\n<li>Supply chain disruptions, delays, and added import duties; reports of decreased package volumes and canceled or delayed orders in logistics and small retail.</li>\n<li>Limited evidence of reshoring or job creation; firms may \u201cwait it out\u201d or circumvent tariffs; rebuilding domestic supply chains seen as difficult.</li>\n<li>Deteriorating trade relationships and likely retaliation; damage to U.S. soft power and global competitiveness; policy unpredictability deters investment.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some cite analyses projecting lower long-run GDP and wages under broad tariff regimes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perceived benefits (positive views):</p>\n</li>\n<li>Protection for domestic industries, encouragement of \u201cbuy American,\u201d and potential long-run reshoring once adjustments are made.</li>\n<li>Use of tariffs as leverage to renegotiate trade terms and address perceived unfairness.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increased tariff revenue to the treasury and possible deficit reduction; advocates frame short-term pain as paving the way for longer-term gains or a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nuance and conditions:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Several comments stress short-term negatives with potential long-term positives if policies are stable, targeted, and paired with broader industrial strategy.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few note that companies are finding workarounds, limiting impact, or argue that targeted, strategic tariffs would be preferable to broad, blanket measures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bottom line: The balance of opinion is negative, centered on price increases and consumer burden, small-business strain, global retaliation risks, and investment uncertainty.
