Some supporters believe that a nation with abundant resources has a moral obligation to help others achieve a safe and better life.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who oppose the policy primarily cite economic and social strain on the country. The core arguments against acceptance are that the nation should prioritize its own citizens, especially when facing its own economic challenges and debt. This viewpoint expresses concern that accepting more refugees diverts limited resources and puts additional pressure on social systems.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments hold a conditional view. These individuals support the idea of accepting refugees but insist on strict conditions. The most common stipulations include a thorough vetting process for all applicants, clear limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negatively impacting citizens, and providing resources to help refugees integrate into society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
