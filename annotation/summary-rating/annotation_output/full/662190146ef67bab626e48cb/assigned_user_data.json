Several specifically mention concerns for vulnerable populations, including those experiencing domestic abuse, people with minority political views, and individuals seeking support or resources online. The risk of identity theft and data breaches is frequently cited, with respondents worrying about companies mishandling or selling their personal information.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Numerous comments emphasize that anonymity enables free speech and protects users from real-world consequences like job loss or social marginalization.
