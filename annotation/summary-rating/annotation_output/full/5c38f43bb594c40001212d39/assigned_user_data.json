Below is a summary of the key themes and opinions:</p>\n<h6><strong>1. Opposition to the Current Tipping System</strong></h6>\n<p>A significant portion of the comments criticize the tipping system as being overly burdensome, intrusive, or unfair. Many argue that it has become a way for employers to underpay workers, placing the financial responsibility on consumers instead of businesses. Comments frequently highlight the discomfort of being pressured to tip for minimal or no service, such as at fast food counters or self-service kiosks. Others mention that tipping is often presented as mandatory, especially through digital prompts at checkout, making it difficult to decline.</p>\n<h6><strong>2. Concerns About Low Wages and Worker Fairness</strong></h6>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that tipped workers should not be paid below a living wage. Many commenters argue that the system is flawed because it forces service workers to rely heavily on tips to survive. There is strong support for raising the minimum wage for all workers, particularly in the service industry, so that tips are not a necessity. Some suggest that a service charge could be added to the bill instead of relying on voluntary tipping.</p>\n<h6><strong>3. Suggestions for Reform</strong></h6>\n<p>Several commenters proposed alternative models or reforms. These include:\n- Eliminating the tipping system entirely and incorporating a service charge into the bill.\n- Making tipping optional and limiting it to situations where direct, high-quality service is provided.\n- Ensuring that tips are not taxed and that workers are paid a fair base wage.\n- Adopting a European-style model where tipping is less expected and wages are higher.\n- Standardizing tipping amounts or limiting the frequency of tipping requests.</p>\n<h6><strong>4. Support for Tipping as a Voluntary Gesture</strong></h6>\n<p>Some commenters support tipping when it is given voluntarily in response to good service. They argue that it is a way to reward excellent work and that it can be a meaningful way to show appreciation. However, even among supporters, there is a common sentiment that the system has become too pervasive and that people should not feel obligated to tip in every situation.</p>\n<h6><strong>5. Mixed or Conflicted Views</strong></h6>\n<p>A few commenters expressed ambivalence or uncertainty. While they recognize the need for fair wages and the value of good service, they also acknowledge the complexity of the issue and the difficulty in finding a perfect solution. Some expressed a desire for a system that is fair to both workers and consumers without placing undue pressure on either side.</p>\n<h6><strong>6. Cultural and Regional Perspectives</strong></h6>\n<p>Some comments reference the uniqueness of the U.S. tipping culture, noting that it is not as common in other countries. A few commenters suggested that the system should be localized, with tipping being more appropriate in full-service restaurants and less so in other settings.</p>\n<h6><strong>7. Criticism of Forced or Invasive Tipping Practices</strong></h6>\n<p>Many commenters are frustrated with the way tipping is often presented to customers, particularly through digital interfaces. They argue that the default settings on point-of-sale systems often encourage or pressure customers to tip, making it difficult to decline. There is a strong call for more transparent and optional tipping practices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h6><strong>Summary of Overall Sentiment</strong></h6>\n<p>The tipping system is widely viewed as problematic by a majority of commenters, particularly due to its association with low wages and the pressure it places on consumers. While some see it as a way to reward good service, many believe it has been distorted by business practices that prioritize profit over fairness. There is strong support for systemic change, including raising wages, eliminating mandatory tipping prompts, and implementing alternative payment models that ensure workers are fairly compensated without relying on consumer generosity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "type": "comparison", "model": "comparison", "num_samples_group": 70, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": "gemini-2.5-pro", "model_b": "qwen3-32b", "summary_a_id": "3e191546dfb7b49e", "summary_b_id": "8821c5a0067cf32e", "summary_a_text": "Based on the comments provided, here is an overall summary:\n\nThere is a strong and widespread dissatisfaction with the current tipping culture, which many describe as \"out of control,\" \"overkill,\" and \"forced.\" A central theme is the belief that tipping has expanded beyond its original intent, with requests for tips now common for minimal or even non-existent service, such as pickup orders and basic counter transactions.
