They express empathy, stating it is the \"right thing to do\" to help those fleeing life-threatening situations of war and persecution. This viewpoint is often linked to American identity, with some citing the nation's history as a haven for those escaping persecution and a belief that it should set a positive example for the world. Others feel the U.S. has a moral obligation or even a direct responsibility to help, sometimes due to the consequences of its own foreign policy. The potential for cultural enrichment and the idea that the U.S. has abundant resources to share are also mentioned as reasons for support.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable group opposes accepting more refugees. The primary concern is the strain on national resources, with arguments that the country is in debt and should prioritize its own struggling citizens first. These commenters feel that current systems are already overwhelmed and that accepting more people would negatively impact the economy, social services, and the quality of life for Americans. Some also express concerns about crime and the logistical challenge of managing a large influx of people.</p>\n<p>A significant percentage of opinions fall into a conditional or conflicted category. Many who are open to accepting refugees attach strict conditions. The most frequently cited condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to screen out criminals and ensure national security. Other common stipulations include setting clear limits on the number of refugees, ensuring their acceptance does not negatively impact the economy or create resource competition with citizens, and providing education for integration into American society. Some distinguish between \"genuine refugees\" and economic migrants, supporting only the former. The sentiment that the current immigration system is broken and needs fixing before accepting more people is also a recurring theme.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 28s "}}
