Common concerns center around privacy, safety, and data security, with many believing anonymity protects vulnerable individuals, prevents doxxing, and avoids potential misuse of personal data by companies or governments. Opponents also argue that such a requirement could suppress free expression and lead to real-world consequences like job loss or harassment.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments support the idea, citing increased accountability, reduced cyberbullying, and fewer scams or bots as key benefits.

These often suggest compromise solutions, such as optional real-name use or verified identity systems that don\u2019t publicly display personal information.
