Several felt it\u2019s unrealistic as a primary career for most and can promote skewed ideas of success to younger audiences.</li>\n<li>Conditions and expectations: Many called for responsibility, transparency (clear ad/sponsorship and AI disclosures), media literacy, accountability standards, and even labor protections (fair contracts, unions, safety nets). Several suggested it\u2019s best pursued as a side hustle unless sustainable traction is proven.</li>\n<li>Role in media: Some view influencers as supplementing or partially replacing traditional news and advertising; others warn against relying on them as sole information sources.</li>\n<li>Bottom line: Influencing is broadly recognized as real work with meaningful opportunities, but sustained legitimacy hinges on authenticity, ethical practices, and clearer norms that mitigate misinformation and exploitative dynamics.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 27s "}}
