The debate centers on the tension between promoting accountability and protecting user privacy and safety.</p>\n<p>A notable portion of commenters supported the requirement, primarily arguing that it would foster accountability and improve online behavior. Proponents believe that attaching real identities to online activity would reduce negative behaviors such as cyberbullying, harassment, misinformation, and scams. They argued that anonymity enables a culture of cruelty and that real-name policies would create a safer, more authentic online environment. Other reasons for support included combating bots, impersonation, identity theft, and protecting vulnerable users like minors from predators.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a larger percentage of participants strongly opposed the measure, citing major concerns about privacy, safety, and freedom of expression. The most common argument was that it constitutes a severe invasion of privacy. Many expressed a deep distrust of social media companies, fearing their personal data would be misused, sold, or leaked in data breaches. Opponents also highlighted significant safety risks, arguing that a real-name policy could expose users to real-world harm, including doxxing, stalking, job loss for expressing certain political views, and danger for vulnerable individuals like domestic abuse survivors. The right to anonymity was frequently described as a crucial aspect of online freedom, allowing people to express themselves without fear of reprisal.</p>\n<p>Several individuals offered nuanced or conditional perspectives. Some suggested a compromise where users verify their identity with the platform privately but can still post publicly under a pseudonym. This would allow platforms to take action against malicious behavior while preserving user anonymity. Others proposed optional verification systems, like a checkmark for those who choose to confirm their identity. A few participants saw both the advantages and disadvantages, acknowledging that while the policy could curb harassment, it also presented undeniable privacy risks, leaving them feeling ambivalent.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}
