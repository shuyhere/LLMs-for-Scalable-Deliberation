The most prevalent argument was that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and should be accessible to all regardless of income, class, or employment status. Many felt it was the government's moral duty to care for its citizens' well-being.</p>\n<p>Several participants pointed to the current system's failures, citing prohibitive costs, lack of access, and the fear of medical debt as significant problems. They argued that a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes through preventative care and early diagnosis. The fact that most other developed nations have universal healthcare was a frequently mentioned point, with many expressing that the U.S. is lagging behind. Some also framed the issue as an economic necessity, arguing a healthier population is a more productive one.</p>\n<p>While support was widespread, some commenters attached specific conditions. A recurring theme was the importance of choice, with several advocating for a public option that coexists with private insurance rather than a single-payer system. Others conditioned their support on the system's ability to deliver care in a timely manner. The scope of care was also a point of discussion, with some specifying support for \"basic\" care but not \"extensive\" coverage.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of commenters opposed the idea. Their primary concerns were that a government-run system would be inefficient, wasteful, and provide a lower quality of care compared to the private sector. They also raised objections based on the potential cost to taxpayers and a philosophical opposition to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 0s "}}
