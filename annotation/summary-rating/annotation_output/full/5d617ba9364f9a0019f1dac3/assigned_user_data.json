Many note that companies will likely transfer tariff costs to customers, making everyday products more expensive and creating additional hardship for Americans already struggling economically. Several commenters worry about inflationary pressures and the potential for reduced consumer spending, which could harm overall economic growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Perspectives Supporting the Policy</strong>\nThose who view the policy favorably argue that tariffs could strengthen the U.S. economy in the long term by encouraging domestic production and generating federal revenue. Some believe previous trade arrangements were unfair to the U.S. and that current policies will help stabilize the economy. A few respondents express confidence in the administration's business acumen and believe short-term challenges will lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>International Trade and Relations</strong>\nMultiple comments highlight concerns about deteriorating international relationships, particularly with China. Respondents worry that aggressive tariff policies could isolate the U.S. economically and damage its reputation as a reliable trading partner. Some note that affected countries are already seeking alternative trade arrangements that exclude the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>Manufacturing and Industry Considerations</strong>\nSeveral commenters question whether tariffs will achieve their stated goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., citing the difficulty of rebuilding lost supply chains and factories. Others suggest that while certain domestic industries may benefit from protection, the overall economic impact across all sectors will be negative. Some express skepticism about the effectiveness of the policies, noting that companies are finding ways to circumvent them.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term vs. Short-term Effects</strong>\nThe comments reflect tension between short-term costs and potential long-term benefits. While some acknowledge immediate negative impacts but hope for future positive outcomes, others fear that the policies will lead to recession and disproportionately harm middle-class Americans. Economic uncertainty and market instability emerge as recurring concerns throughout the responses.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "num_samples_group": 30, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><h2>Summary of Comments on Tariff Policy Impact</h2>\n<p>The comments reveal deeply divided perspectives on the current tariff policy's impact on the U.S. economy. </p>\n<p><strong>Economic Impact Concerns</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents express concern about negative economic consequences, particularly regarding price increases passed on to consumers.
