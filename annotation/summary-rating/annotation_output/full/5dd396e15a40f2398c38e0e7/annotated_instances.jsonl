Many want employers to pay a living wage so workers don\u2019t rely on tips, with tips becoming optional or eliminated altogether.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping is appropriate: Strong support for reserving tipping for sit-down, service-heavy experiences and for above-and-beyond service. Many object to prompts for pickups, drive-thru, coffee counters, or self-service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment models preferred:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Pay a living wage or at least the full minimum wage to tipped workers; end sub-minimum wages.</li>\n<li>Either eliminate tipping and raise prices or replace it with a built-in service charge (often suggested around 10%), with optional tipping for exceptional service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If tipping remains, it should be post-service, voluntary, and merit-based.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frustrations and concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\u201cTipflation\u201d and social pressure from tablet prompts, especially pre-service; desire for an easy, visible \u201cno tip\u201d option.</li>\n<li>Feeling that tipping lets employers underpay and shifts costs to customers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unpredictable income for workers and confusion about how much to tip.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority views and variations:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Some consistently tip generously and see it as a valuable incentive for good service.</li>\n<li>A few favor standardized or even mandatory approaches (fixed-amount tips instead of percentages, or mandatory tips unless wages meet a threshold, and ideas like no taxes on tips or employer matching).</li>\n<li>\n<p>A handful would limit tipping strictly to restaurant servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Values that recur: Fair compensation via wages, clarity and transparency, limiting intrusive asks, aligning tipping with service quality, and reducing pressure on consumers while ensuring workers are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}
