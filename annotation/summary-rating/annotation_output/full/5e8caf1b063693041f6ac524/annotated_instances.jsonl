Many believe it is the \"right thing to do,\" citing compassion, empathy, and the responsibility to help those facing life-threatening situations. Several argued that accepting refugees aligns with core American values, as the nation was founded by people fleeing persecution. Another prominent reason for support was a sense of national responsibility, with some pointing out that U.S. foreign policy has, at times, contributed to the conflicts that create refugees. A few also saw potential benefits, such as increased cultural diversity and economic contributions.</p>\n<p>However, this support was frequently conditional. The most common condition was the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Many who supported the idea also emphasized the need for limits and a balanced approach to prevent straining national resources or negatively impacting the quality of life for current citizens.</p>\n<p>A smaller group voiced opposition to accepting more refugees. The primary reason for this stance was the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens and internal problems, such as national debt and poverty, before taking on more responsibilities. These commentators expressed concern that an influx of refugees would further strain the economy, social systems, and resources. Some also felt the immigration system is already overwhelmed and being abused, while others suggested refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n<p>A few participants were conflicted, torn between the humanitarian desire to help and concerns about the domestic impact on resources and societal strain.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
