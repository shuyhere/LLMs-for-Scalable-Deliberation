The most frequently cited reasons include:</p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare as a fundamental right:</strong> Many participants emphasized that healthcare should be considered a basic human right, not a privilege or luxury dependent on income or employment status. Respondents argued that in a wealthy, developed nation, no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities like food or shelter.</p>\n<p><strong>International comparisons:</strong> A significant percentage of comments pointed to other developed countries that successfully provide universal healthcare, noting that the United States is an outlier among \"first world\" nations in not offering this benefit to its citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic concerns:</strong> Respondents frequently highlighted the prohibitive cost of private health insurance and medical care, mentioning that medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy. Many shared personal experiences of being unable to afford insurance or avoiding medical care due to cost concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Public health benefits:</strong> Supporters argued that universal coverage would improve overall public health through better access to preventive care, early disease detection, and timely treatment. Several noted this would ultimately reduce healthcare costs for society.</p>\n<p><strong>Government responsibility:</strong> Many participants viewed providing healthcare as a fundamental duty of government to ensure the wellbeing of its citizens, comparable to providing national security or other essential services.</p>\n<p>Among the minority who opposed or expressed reservations about government-provided health insurance, concerns included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Potential negative impacts on quality of care and wait times</li>\n<li>Increased government control and monitoring of individuals</li>\n<li>Cost to taxpayers and impact on other public services</li>\n<li>Preference for private sector efficiency over government management</li>\n<li>Concerns about people receiving benefits without contributing to the system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some respondents advocated for a hybrid approach, supporting a public option alongside private insurance to maintain choice, or suggested providing basic coverage only to those who cannot afford private insurance.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect strong public sentiment favoring some form of government involvement in ensuring universal access to healthcare, with most viewing it as both a moral imperative and a practical necessity for a functioning society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
