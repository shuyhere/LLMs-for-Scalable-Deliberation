They emphasize protecting public health, achieving herd immunity, safeguarding vulnerable people, ending outbreaks faster, and prioritizing the common good over some individual preferences in crises.</li>\n<li>Around 9% offer conditional support, stressing that mandates should apply only in truly severe situations, be time-limited, and rely on transparent, evidence-based decisions with vaccines that are proven safe/effective, properly approved, and accessible (ideally free).</li>\n<li>Approximately 13% favor enforcing quarantine but oppose mandatory vaccination. Many in this group support voluntary vaccination, sometimes paired with access rules or other consequences for those who decline.</li>\n<li>Roughly 29% oppose government enforcement (especially vaccine mandates). Their reasons include bodily autonomy and consent, constitutional/civil liberty concerns, distrust of government/public health agencies, perceived poor handling of COVID-19, and worries about vaccine safety or insufficient long-term data. Several still support education, transparency, and voluntary uptake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional themes\n- Some supporters proposed penalties or restrictions for noncompliance; others insisted mandates be carefully bounded, evidence-based, and lifted as conditions improve.\n- Opponents often called for better public communication and voluntary measures rather than coercion.\n- The tone ranged from pragmatic to highly charged, with a few comments using strong or inflammatory language.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
