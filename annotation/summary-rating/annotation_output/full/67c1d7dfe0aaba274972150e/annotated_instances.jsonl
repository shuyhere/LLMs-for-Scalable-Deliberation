The most common sentiment is that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, expanding far beyond its traditional boundaries into situations where minimal or no service is provided.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents advocate for completely eliminating the tipping system, arguing that employers should pay their workers living wages rather than relying on customers to subsidize employee compensation. Many note that the United States is unique in its heavy reliance on tipping and suggest adopting European models where service charges are built into prices and workers receive fair base wages.</p>\n<p>The expansion of tipping requests is a major point of contention. People express particular frustration with being prompted to tip for counter service, pickup orders, and simple transactions like purchasing pre-made items. The prevalence of digital payment systems with preset tipping options is seen as manipulative and uncomfortable, creating pressure to tip even when inappropriate.</p>\n<p>Among those who support tipping in principle, most believe it should be reserved for genuine service situations\u2014primarily sit-down restaurants and delivery services\u2014where workers provide direct, personalized attention. They emphasize that tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages, and that tipping should remain voluntary and merit-based.</p>\n<p>Several respondents acknowledge the difficult position of service workers who depend on tips due to extremely low base wages, particularly the $2.13 per hour minimum for tipped workers. While sympathetic to these workers' needs, they view this as a systemic problem requiring legislative solutions rather than continued reliance on customer generosity.</p>\n<p>The comments also highlight practical concerns about the current system: its unpredictability for workers' income, confusion about appropriate tipping amounts and situations, and the social awkwardness created by constant tipping requests. Some suggest compromise solutions like fixed service charges or higher menu prices that include fair wages, making the true cost of services transparent while ensuring workers receive consistent, livable compensation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 31s "}}
