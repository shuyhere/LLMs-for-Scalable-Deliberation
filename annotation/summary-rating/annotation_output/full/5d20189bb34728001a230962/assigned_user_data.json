There is also skepticism that the tariffs will succeed in their goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>In contrast, about 18% of the comments express a positive view of the tariff policy. These participants often see the tariffs as a necessary measure to correct unfair trade imbalances that have disadvantaged the U.S. for years. The belief is that the policy will protect domestic industries, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, and generate significant revenue for the U.S. treasury. Some of these comments express confidence in the administration's business expertise and long-term strategy, suggesting that any current difficulties are temporary steps toward future economic strength and prosperity.</p>\n<p>A small portion of the feedback, around 8%, presents a more mixed or nuanced perspective.
