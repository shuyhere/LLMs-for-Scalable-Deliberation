They argue that these higher expenses strain household budgets, reduce consumer spending, and disproportionately affect lower- and middle-income families.

There are fears that these policies could lead to economic instability, job losses, and increased inflation.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of commenters support the tariffs, viewing them as a necessary measure to address trade imbalances, protect domestic industries, and generate federal revenue.
