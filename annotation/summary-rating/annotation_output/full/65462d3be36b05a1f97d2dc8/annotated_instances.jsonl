Their primary concerns were rooted in individual liberty and skepticism. Key arguments against this position include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bodily Autonomy and Individual Rights:</strong> The most frequent argument against enforcement was that individuals should have the right to choose what they put into their own bodies, viewing mandates as a government overreach or an infringement on personal freedom.</li>\n<li><strong>Vaccine Safety Concerns:</strong> Many expressed distrust in vaccines developed quickly during a crisis, citing the lack of long-term studies and concerns about potential side effects, with several referencing negative experiences with COVID-19 vaccines.</li>\n<li><strong>Mistrust of Government:</strong> A significant number of opponents cited a lack of trust in the government, referencing poor handling of past epidemics, a perceived lack of transparency, and the belief that officials acted with false certainty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nuanced Positions</strong></p>\n<p>A recurring nuanced view distinguished between the two measures.
