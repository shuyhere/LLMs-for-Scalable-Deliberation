The majority of respondents view healthcare as a fundamental human right and argue that it should not be determined by income, employment status, or ability to pay. Many emphasize the moral obligation of the government to ensure that all citizens have access to necessary medical care, especially in a country as wealthy and resource-rich as the United States.</p>\n<p>A common concern is the current high cost and limited accessibility of private healthcare, with several commenters noting that it often leads to financial hardship, medical debt, or even preventable deaths. Many respondents draw comparisons to other developed nations, particularly Canada, where universal healthcare is seen as a model of efficiency and fairness. They argue that the U.S. lags behind in this area and that adopting a similar system would improve public health outcomes and reduce overall costs.</p>\n<p>Some commenters advocate for a public option alongside private insurance, emphasizing the importance of maintaining choice while ensuring that everyone has a baseline level of coverage. Others express concerns about government inefficiency and the potential for overreach, though these views are in the minority. A few respondents oppose government-provided healthcare altogether, citing a preference for private market solutions and a general distrust of expanding government roles.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment is that universal healthcare is not only a moral imperative but also a practical solution to a growing public health and economic crisis. The idea that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege, is a recurring theme, with many emphasizing the societal benefits of a healthier, more equitable population.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
