Many respondents express frustration with the expansion of tipping expectations beyond traditional service contexts, particularly noting the proliferation of tip requests in basic transactions where minimal or no service is provided.</p>\n<p>A substantial portion of respondents advocate for eliminating tipping entirely, while others support maintaining it only as a genuine reward for quality service rather than an obligation. The most prominent theme throughout the comments is the need for employers to pay livable base wages to their workers, removing employees' dependence on tips for basic income.</p>\n<p>Several specific concerns emerge from the feedback:</p>\n<p><strong>Tipping Fatigue and Pressure</strong>: Respondents describe feeling \"bullied\" into tipping and overwhelmed by constant tip prompts in situations where tipping was not traditionally expected. The ubiquitous digital tip screens at point-of-sale systems are particularly mentioned as creating unwanted pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform</strong>: There's widespread agreement that the root issue is inadequate base wages for service workers. Multiple comments emphasize that employers should bear the responsibility of paying fair wages rather than shifting this burden to customers through tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Voluntary vs. Mandatory</strong>: Strong opposition exists to mandatory tipping, with preferences for a voluntary system that genuinely reflects service quality and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Creative Solutions</strong>: Some respondents suggest innovative approaches, such as providing customers with tangible benefits for tipping (like thank you notes or future discounts) or shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping standards.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment indicates that while people recognize tipping can benefit service workers, the current system has become problematic in its scope and implementation. The comments suggest a desire for a more balanced approach that ensures fair worker compensation without creating excessive pressure on customers or extending tipping culture into inappropriate contexts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 33s "}}
