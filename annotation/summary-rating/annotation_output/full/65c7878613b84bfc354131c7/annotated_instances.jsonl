Many proponents argue that the current private, market-based system is failing, citing concerns over prohibitive costs, lack of access for the unemployed and low-income individuals, and poor health outcomes compared to other developed nations. A common theme is the belief that it is the government's responsibility to ensure the well-being of its citizens and that universal healthcare would lead to a healthier, more productive population and better economic stability by preventing medical debt and bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express opposition or partial support, with concerns primarily focused on government inefficiency, the potential high cost to taxpayers, and a preference for maintaining choice through a mix of public and private options. Some supporters also attach conditions to their approval, emphasizing the importance of timely care and administrative efficiency.</p>\n<p>The sentiment overall leans heavily towards viewing universal healthcare as a moral imperative and a marker of a developed society, with frequent comparisons made to other countries that already provide such systems.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 13s "}}
