On the positive side, many commenters appreciate the pace of innovation, citing improved performance, enhanced security, better camera quality, and access to new features and apps.

Many individuals feel that the rapid update cycle is driven more by marketing and profit motives than by meaningful innovation. Several commenters accuse manufacturers of planned obsolescence, noting that older devices often stop receiving updates, lose functionality, or become incompatible with newer software.
