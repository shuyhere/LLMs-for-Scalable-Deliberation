Most commenters argue that education is foundational for a healthy society and economy, warning that cuts would harm students (especially those with fewer resources), degrade the quality and safety of education, and undermine long\u2011term innovation, competitiveness, and medical research. Several predict brain drain as researchers move abroad and express concern about eroding trust in institutions. A number of comments frame the cuts as politically motivated or authoritarian in intent.</p>\n<p>A smaller share offers conditional or supportive views: some believe universities exhibit ideological bias and see reductions as justified or as a way to curb waste and prompt reform; a few express confidence that alternative solutions will follow; and a couple are unsure without more details. Even among mixed views, there is a recurring call to balance fiscal discipline with sustained investment in education and research rather than broad cuts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 5s "}}
