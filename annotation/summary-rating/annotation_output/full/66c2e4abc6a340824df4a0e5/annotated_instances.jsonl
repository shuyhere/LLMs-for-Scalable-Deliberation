Many see it as profit-driven and wasteful, with minimal year-over-year gains that pressure consumers to upgrade unnecessarily. Planned obsolescence, rising prices, frequent accessory/charger changes, and limited repairability are recurring complaints, alongside concerns about environmental impact and electronic waste.</p>\n<p>What people value:\n- Security updates and reliability, with some preferring predictable, less frequent updates (e.g., monthly) that are well tested.\n- Genuine innovation (e.g., major camera or performance leaps, foldables, longer battery life) and competition that pushes meaningful improvements.\n- Longevity: longer OS support, better durability, and repairability over flashy annual hardware refreshes.</p>\n<p>Common pain points:\n- Updates introducing bugs, performance slowdowns, or privacy concerns.\n- Older models losing support or functionality prematurely, making devices feel obsolete.\n- Update fatigue and the time burden of frequent patches.\n- Perceived \u201ccash grab\u201d tactics, incremental upgrades, higher prices (sometimes tied to tariffs), and bloatware.</p>\n<p>Behavior and perceptions:\n- Many prefer to keep devices for several years and skip annual releases, noting that real improvements are noticeable only every 2\u20133 generations.\n- Some acknowledge positives: improved cameras, efficiency, and the convenience of ever-better \u201cmini computers\u201d in daily life.\n- A subset expresses broader social worries (consumerism, youth impacts, digital divide) and geopolitical competition in tech.</p>\n<p>Suggested path forward:\n- Shift to a slower hardware cadence (every 2\u20133 years) with longer, high-quality software support in between.\n- Prioritize stability, privacy, and security over rapid feature churn; reduce bloatware.\n- Design for longevity and repairability; maintain accessory standards where possible.\n- Be transparent about the actual benefits of upgrades and support older devices longer.\n- Explore revenue via services, apps, or optional feature subscriptions rather than frequent hardware turnover.</p>\n<p>In short, people want fewer but better-tested hardware releases, strong and sustained software support, and a more sustainable, consumer-friendly approach that balances innovation with longevity and environmental responsibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 50s "}}
