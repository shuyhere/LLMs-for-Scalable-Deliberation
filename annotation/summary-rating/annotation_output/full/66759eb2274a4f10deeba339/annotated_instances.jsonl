A hybrid model that guarantees a baseline of care, preserves options, and focuses on efficient, timely delivery emerges as a common middle ground.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}
