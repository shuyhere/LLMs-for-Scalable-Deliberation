Many feel it\u2019s overextended, pressured, and appearing in situations that don\u2019t warrant it (counter service, pickup, simple transactions). Tipping before service and aggressive tablet prompts were frequent pain points.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay and responsibility: A strong majority want employers to pay a fair, livable wage and to end the sub-minimum \u201ctipped wage,\u201d so tips return to being a bonus for exceptional service rather than a wage substitute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping belongs: Many want tipping limited to full-service dining and delivery. Counter service, coffee shops, and simple pickups were commonly cited as contexts where tipping should be optional or not requested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How tipping should work: Most prefer tipping to be voluntary and tied to quality of service, not mandatory or \u201cexpected.\u201d Some propose service-inclusive pricing or a modest automatic service charge (often cited at around 10%), with discretionary tipping on top for exceptional service. A smaller group supports keeping or even increasing standard tip levels (20\u201330%) as performance incentives.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Point-of-sale practices: People want clearer, less coercive interfaces\u2014easy-to-find \u201cno tip\u201d options, no auto-prompts in low-service contexts, and tipping requested only after service is rendered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Standardization and alternative ideas: Suggestions included eliminating taxes on tips, employers matching a portion of tips, fixed amount tips rather than percentages for small bills, setting fair suggested ranges, and adopting European or Japanese-style models (service charge built in, no tipping).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equity and predictability: Commenters noted tipping\u2019s unpredictability for workers and the social pressure on consumers. Many prefer stable wages with transparent pricing, allowing tips to function as genuine appreciation rather than obligation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 36s "}}
