Even among positive users, caution about accuracy, privacy, and dependence is common.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most-cited benefits:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Efficiency and productivity: faster research, instant summaries, drafting and editing emails, letters, resumes, policies, and proposals; planning events and trips; organizing tasks; brainstorming ideas; automating repetitive work; code/data help; note taking.</li>\n<li>Learning and support: tutoring-style explanations, simplifying complex topics, homework help, language learning, study aids, and confidence approaching problems.</li>\n<li>Creativity: ideation, overcoming writer\u2019s block, art and image editing/design, content prompts, shirt designs, and story generation.</li>\n<li>Everyday life: recipe and meal planning (including dietary constraints), smart-home support, voice/dictation cleanup, skincare and fitness guidance, investing steps, sports analysis, and entertainment.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Emotional support: some found chatbots helpful for advice, perspective-taking in conflicts, and mental health encouragement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common usage patterns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many use AI daily or frequently as an \u201cassistant\u201d that saves time and improves output quality.</li>\n<li>Others treat it as an optional tool for quick ideas or search augmentation.</li>\n<li>A notable group say it hasn\u2019t changed their life much yet, or they use it rarely.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several users emphasize they fact-check AI, verify sources, and use it as a starting point rather than a final authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accuracy and bias concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Information can be inaccurate or irrelevant; users often validate claims and sources.</li>\n<li>Perceived bias in what sources are surfaced.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some tools help fix spelling/grammar and clarify text, but outputs still require human review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trust, authenticity, and societal effects:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Heightened distrust online due to deepfakes, AI-generated art/writing, and difficulty knowing what\u2019s real.</li>\n<li>Worries about diminished critical thinking and originality when over-relying on AI.</li>\n<li>Educators note new challenges teaching authenticity and academic integrity.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few users actively avoid AI content, calling it harmful or \u201ctheft.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy and security:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Strong, recurring anxiety about data collection, tracking, and lack of consent.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wariness about how personal information might be used or exposed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jobs and economy:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Split views: AI as a threat to job security versus a tool that enhances employability or creates side-gig opportunities.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some professionals fear eventual replacement; others report major productivity gains or new income streams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Environmental and regulatory notes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>A small share mention environmental costs and call for stronger regulation, alongside continued innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: For many, AI functions as a powerful assistant that streamlines work, learning, and creativity, delivering meaningful time savings and better outcomes. At the same time, users widely recognize risks\u2014especially privacy, accuracy, overdependence, and authenticity\u2014and often respond by fact-checking, limiting use in certain contexts, or calling for guardrails to preserve trust and human originality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 55s "}}
