These supporters believe such measures are the most effective way to prevent the spread of disease, achieve herd immunity, save lives, and allow society to return to normalcy more quickly. Many view it as the government's responsibility to protect its citizens during a crisis. However, some of this support is conditional, suggesting that enforcement is only acceptable if the epidemic is truly severe, the vaccines are proven safe and effective, and the measures are temporary.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of commenters oppose government enforcement. The most prominent arguments against it are rooted in individual liberty, bodily autonomy, and the right to choose what goes into one's body. Many of these commenters expressed a deep mistrust of the government, citing a perceived lack of transparency, poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and loss of credibility. Concerns about vaccine safety, particularly regarding rapidly developed vaccines and potential side effects, were also a major factor in their opposition.</p>\n<p>A smaller group holds a more nuanced view, differentiating between the two measures. These individuals often support the enforcement of quarantines as a necessary tool to control an outbreak but strongly oppose mandatory vaccinations, viewing them as a greater infringement on personal health and freedom.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
