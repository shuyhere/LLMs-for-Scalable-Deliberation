A common theme among the criticisms is the belief that tipping is often a way for employers to underpay workers rather than a fair or optional gesture of appreciation. Many commenters argue that service workers should receive a livable wage from their employers, and that tipping should not be expected for every transaction, particularly in fast food or counter service settings.</p>\n<p>Supporters of tipping generally agree that it should be based on the quality of service and left to the discretion of the customer. Some view it as a way to reward excellent service and encourage good work, while others express concern that tipping has become too transactional or even coercive, especially with the rise of digital tipping prompts and default suggested amounts.</p>\n<p>Several commenters suggest alternatives to the current system, such as a flat service charge added to the bill, or adopting models used in other countries where tipping is less prevalent or expected. Others propose eliminating tipping altogether and replacing it with a fair wage structure for service workers.</p>\n<p>There is also a sentiment that the tipping culture has become excessive and confusing, with tips expected for even minimal or no service. Many express frustration with the pressure to tip in situations where service is not clearly provided, or where the service is poor but tipping is still expected.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments highlight a growing desire for reform in the tipping system, with a strong emphasis on fair wages for service workers and a more voluntary, service-based tipping culture.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 9m 7s "}}
