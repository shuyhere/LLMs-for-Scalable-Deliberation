Many believe the current system is <strong>flawed</strong>, <strong>confusing</strong>, and <strong>unfair to both consumers and workers</strong>, and advocate for <strong>reforms</strong> that prioritize <strong>fair wages and voluntary tipping</strong> based on service quality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>Overall summary of comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Broad sentiment: Tipping culture feels overextended, coercive, and confusing. Many want employers to pay a living wage so workers don\u2019t rely on tips, with tips becoming optional or eliminated altogether.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping is appropriate: Strong support for reserving tipping for sit-down, service-heavy experiences and for above-and-beyond service. Many object to prompts for pickups, drive-thru, coffee counters, or self-service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment models preferred:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Pay a living wage or at least the full minimum wage to tipped workers; end sub-minimum wages.</li>\n<li>Either eliminate tipping and raise prices or replace it with a built-in service charge (often suggested around 10%), with optional tipping for exceptional service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If tipping remains, it should be post-service, voluntary, and merit-based.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frustrations and concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\u201cTipflation\u201d and social pressure from tablet prompts, especially pre-service; desire for an easy, visible \u201cno tip\u201d option.</li>\n<li>Feeling that tipping lets employers underpay and shifts costs to customers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unpredictable income for workers and confusion about how much to tip.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority views and variations:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Some consistently tip generously and see it as a valuable incentive for good service.</li>\n<li>A few favor standardized or even mandatory approaches (fixed-amount tips instead of percentages, or mandatory tips unless wages meet a threshold, and ideas like no taxes on tips or employer matching).</li>\n<li>\n<p>A handful would limit tipping strictly to restaurant servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Values that recur: Fair compensation via wages, clarity and transparency, limiting intrusive asks, aligning tipping with service quality, and reducing pressure on consumers while ensuring workers are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            "}, "Summary-Rating-end.html": {"id": "Summary-Rating-end.html", "text": "end", "displayed_text": "end"}}
