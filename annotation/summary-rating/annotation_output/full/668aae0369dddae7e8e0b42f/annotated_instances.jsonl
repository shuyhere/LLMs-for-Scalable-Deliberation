Below is a summary of the key themes and opinions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Abolishing or Reforming the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   A significant portion of the feedback suggests eliminating or reforming the tipping system. Many argue that tipping should not be necessary if workers are paid a <strong>livable wage</strong>, as is the case in some European countries. Others propose replacing tipping with a <strong>compulsory service charge</strong> (e.g., 10%) to ensure fair compensation without placing the burden on customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Social Pressure and Expectations</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the <strong>feeling of obligation</strong> to tip, even when service is minimal or not directly received. Many commenters express discomfort with being <strong>asked to tip before or during service</strong>, particularly in fast food or self-service settings. Some feel that tipping has become <strong>over-expected</strong> and <strong>invasive</strong>, especially with digital prompts that make it difficult to decline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Reflection of Service Quality</strong><br />\n   A number of individuals support tipping as a way to <strong>reward good service</strong>, but emphasize that it should be <strong>optional</strong> and <strong>based on the quality of service provided</strong>. Some suggest that <strong>fixed tip amounts</strong> or <strong>tangible rewards</strong> (e.g., thank-you notes, coupons) could improve the system and reduce confusion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Fair Wages and Employer Responsibility</strong><br />\n   A strong sentiment is that <strong>employers should be responsible for paying fair wages</strong>, and that <strong>tipping should not be a substitute</strong> for proper compensation. Many argue that the current system allows businesses to <strong>underpay workers</strong>, forcing them to rely on customer generosity to make ends meet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping in Certain Contexts</strong><br />\n   While many oppose the tipping system in general, some commenters believe it is <strong>appropriate in full-service settings</strong>, such as sit-down restaurants, where <strong>direct service is provided</strong>. However, even in these cases, they often advocate for <strong>making tipping optional</strong> and <strong>not implied</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Regional Differences</strong><br />\n   Several commenters note that tipping is <strong>not a universal practice</strong> and suggest adopting models from other countries where <strong>tipping is either optional or nonexistent</strong>. They argue that the U.S. system is <strong>out of step</strong> with global norms and is often <strong>misapplied</strong> to situations where it is not warranted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Tipping Culture</strong><br />\n   Some view tipping as a <strong>form of consumer exploitation</strong> or <strong>social pressure</strong> that can lead to <strong>inappropriate expectations</strong> from service workers. Others feel that it can be <strong>used as a tool for ego or social status</strong>, rather than a genuine expression of gratitude.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Desire for Simplicity and Transparency</strong><br />\n   Many commenters wish for a more <strong>streamlined and transparent system</strong>, where tipping is <strong>clearly optional</strong>, <strong>not forced</strong>, and <strong>not tied to unnecessary service interactions</strong>. Some suggest that <strong>removing tipping prompts</strong> or <strong>standardizing service charges</strong> could help reduce confusion and pressure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed or Ambivalent Views</strong><br />\n   A few individuals express <strong>conflicted opinions</strong>, acknowledging the need for fair wages for workers while also recognizing the <strong>burden tipping places on consumers</strong>. They suggest a <strong>middle ground</strong> where workers are paid fairly, and tipping is <strong>optional and meaningful</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the majority of feedback reflects a <strong>desire for a more equitable system</strong> where service workers are paid fairly and tipping is <strong>not mandatory or socially pressured</strong>. Many believe the current system is <strong>flawed</strong>, <strong>confusing</strong>, and <strong>unfair to both consumers and workers</strong>, and advocate for <strong>reforms</strong> that prioritize <strong>fair wages and voluntary tipping</strong> based on service quality.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 42s "}}

Many want employers to pay a living wage so workers don\u2019t rely on tips, with tips becoming optional or eliminated altogether.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping is appropriate: Strong support for reserving tipping for sit-down, service-heavy experiences and for above-and-beyond service. Many object to prompts for pickups, drive-thru, coffee counters, or self-service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment models preferred:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Pay a living wage or at least the full minimum wage to tipped workers; end sub-minimum wages.</li>\n<li>Either eliminate tipping and raise prices or replace it with a built-in service charge (often suggested around 10%), with optional tipping for exceptional service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If tipping remains, it should be post-service, voluntary, and merit-based.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frustrations and concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\u201cTipflation\u201d and social pressure from tablet prompts, especially pre-service; desire for an easy, visible \u201cno tip\u201d option.</li>\n<li>Feeling that tipping lets employers underpay and shifts costs to customers.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unpredictable income for workers and confusion about how much to tip.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority views and variations:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Some consistently tip generously and see it as a valuable incentive for good service.</li>\n<li>A few favor standardized or even mandatory approaches (fixed-amount tips instead of percentages, or mandatory tips unless wages meet a threshold, and ideas like no taxes on tips or employer matching).</li>\n<li>\n<p>A handful would limit tipping strictly to restaurant servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Values that recur: Fair compensation via wages, clarity and transparency, limiting intrusive asks, aligning tipping with service quality, and reducing pressure on consumers while ensuring workers are treated fairly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 5s "}}
