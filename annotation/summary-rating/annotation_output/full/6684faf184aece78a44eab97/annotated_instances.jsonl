The primary benefit cited is increased accountability, which supporters believe would lead to a significant reduction in harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Other arguments in favor include the potential to eliminate bots and fake accounts, prevent impersonation and identity theft, and protect vulnerable users, such as minors.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who oppose the requirement raise significant concerns about privacy, safety, and freedom of expression. Many view online anonymity as a right and a crucial tool for protection. They express a deep distrust of social media companies, fearing that their personal data could be sold, misused by governments, or exposed in data breaches, leading to identity theft and fraud. Opponents also argue that linking real identities to online activity could expose users to real-world consequences, such as job loss for expressing political opinions or targeted harassment and stalking. A key concern is that such a policy would silence vulnerable or marginalized individuals who rely on anonymity for safety, such as survivors of domestic abuse.</p>\n<p>A number of comments present a more nuanced or conditional view. Some suggest compromises, such as requiring real-name verification on the platform's backend while allowing users to post under a pseudonym. Another proposed alternative is an optional verification system that would grant a badge or checkmark to verified users, allowing others to choose who they interact with. Some feel the policy could be effective but question whether it could be enforced without being overly intrusive or easily circumvented.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 34s "}}
