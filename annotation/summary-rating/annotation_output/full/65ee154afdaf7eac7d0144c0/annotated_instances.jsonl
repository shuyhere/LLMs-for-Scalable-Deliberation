Many argue that healthcare is a fundamental human right and a necessity rather than a privilege, emphasizing that it should not be determined by income or job status. Commenters frequently highlight the inequities of the current system, noting that healthcare in the U.S. is expensive, inaccessible for many, and results in poor health outcomes compared to other developed nations. The majority view government-run healthcare as a more ethical and efficient solution, especially when compared to for-profit systems that may prioritize profit over patient care.</p>\n<p>Supporters often point to the success of universal healthcare in other countries and argue that the U.S. should follow suit to ensure fairness, reduce medical debt, and improve public health. Preventative care is frequently cited as a key benefit, with the belief that early detection of serious conditions can lead to better outcomes and lower long-term costs. Some suggest expanding existing programs like Medicare as a model for universal coverage.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of commenters express reservations or opposition, citing concerns about government inefficiency, rising tax burdens, and a preference for private healthcare options. A few also question the feasibility of universal coverage or argue that it should not extend to non-citizens.
