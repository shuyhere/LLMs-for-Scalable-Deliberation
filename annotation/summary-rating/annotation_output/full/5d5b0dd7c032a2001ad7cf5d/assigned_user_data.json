The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs function as a tax on consumers. Participants repeatedly stated that companies will pass the increased costs of imported goods on to customers, leading to higher prices for everyday items, increased inflation, and a higher cost of living. This, in turn, is expected to reduce consumer spending and potentially lead to a recession.</p>\n<p>Several individuals in this majority group also expressed concern for small businesses that rely on imported products and materials, with some sharing personal experiences of being negatively affected. Furthermore, many believe the policy damages international relations, provokes retaliatory tariffs from other nations, and harms the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable trading partner. There is also skepticism that the tariffs will succeed in their goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>In contrast, about 18% of the comments express a positive view of the tariff policy. These participants often see the tariffs as a necessary measure to correct unfair trade imbalances that have disadvantaged the U.S. for years. The belief is that the policy will protect domestic industries, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, and generate significant revenue for the U.S. treasury. Some of these comments express confidence in the administration's business expertise and long-term strategy, suggesting that any current difficulties are temporary steps toward future economic strength and prosperity.</p>\n<p>A small portion of the feedback, around 8%, presents a more mixed or nuanced perspective. These comments often frame the issue in terms of short-term pain for long-term gain, acknowledging immediate negative consequences like price increases but holding out hope for positive future outcomes such as better trade deals or a stronger domestic economy. Others noted that the policy has mixed effects, benefiting some industries while harming others, or that its overall impact might be minimal as companies find ways to work around it.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "num_samples_group": 70, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Based on the comments provided, here is a summary of the participants' views on the Trump administration's tariff policy:</p>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of comments, representing approximately 73% of the feedback, predict that the tariff policy will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and society.
