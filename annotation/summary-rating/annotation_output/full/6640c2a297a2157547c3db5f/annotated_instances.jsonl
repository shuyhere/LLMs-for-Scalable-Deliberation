The primary reasons for this opposition center on the value of privacy and the freedom of anonymity. Commenters expressed worries about how companies would handle and potentially misuse large databases of personal information, with some fearing that data could be sold to the government or used to target individuals. Many believe that anonymity is a crucial freedom, allowing people to express themselves without fear of real-world repercussions, such as losing a job for their political beliefs. The potential for intrusive enforcement, like requiring ID documents, was also a significant concern.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those in support of the requirement argued that it would lead to greater accountability and better behavior online. They believe that linking real identities to online activity could significantly reduce negative behaviors like cyberbullying and scams.</p>\n<p>A portion of the comments presented a more nuanced perspective. For some, the acceptability of such a policy depends on who enforces it, viewing it as more acceptable if required by the platform itself rather than the government. Others acknowledged the potential benefits for accountability but ultimately felt that the loss of the freedom to speak anonymously was too high a price to pay.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
