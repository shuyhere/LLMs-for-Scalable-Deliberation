They often compare influencers to traditional celebrities or entertainers, noting that they provide valuable content, from entertainment and product recommendations to information and news. Supporters appreciate that it offers a new form of entrepreneurship, allowing individuals to earn a living by sharing their passions and connecting with audiences on a personal, relatable level. Some see it as a positive democratization of media, giving everyday people a platform to build a career.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of comments express negative views, describing influencers as annoying, inauthentic, or attention-seeking. There are strong concerns about the profession becoming oversaturated, leading to a lack of originality and genuine connection. Critics also worry about the negative societal impact, citing the spread of misinformation, the promotion of overconsumption, and the potential for it to be a poor example for youth who might see it as an \"easy\" career path instead of pursuing traditional education or trades.</p>\n<p>Many comments fall in the middle, acknowledging both the opportunities and the pitfalls. These participants recognize influencing as a real job that requires significant effort and skill, but also call for greater responsibility and accountability. A recurring theme is the need for influencers to be authentic and transparent with their audiences. While some may not personally enjoy the content, they respect it as a viable way for people to earn an income in the modern economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
