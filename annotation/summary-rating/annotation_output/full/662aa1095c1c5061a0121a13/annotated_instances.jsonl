Many commenters argue that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, inflation, and reduced economic stability, particularly for middle-class and low-income households.

Additionally, several commenters express skepticism about the effectiveness of tariffs in achieving their stated goals, such as bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., noting that supply chains are complex and difficult to reverse quickly.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller share of the comments suggest that the tariff policy could have a positive long-term impact, particularly if it helps reduce trade deficits, stabilize the economy, or encourage domestic production.
