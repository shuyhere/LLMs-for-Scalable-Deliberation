A significant portion of respondents oppose the requirement, citing concerns about privacy, data security, potential misuse of personal information by companies or governments, and the importance of anonymity for vulnerable groups such as domestic abuse survivors or those with marginalized political views. Others express support, arguing that real-name registration would increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, scams, and harassment, and help verify user identities to prevent impersonation. Some adopt a middle ground, suggesting optional real-name use or verification systems that allow anonymity but enable identity tracing in cases of misconduct. Advantages highlighted include enhanced credibility and safety, while disadvantages focus on privacy risks and potential real-world consequences.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 17s "}}
