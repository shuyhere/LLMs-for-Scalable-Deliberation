Many express that offering refuge aligns with national values and historical identity. However, a significant portion emphasizes the necessity of rigorous vetting processes to ensure security and screen for criminal backgrounds. Concerns are also raised about economic impacts, resource allocation, and potential strain on public systems, with some advocating for limits to prioritize citizens' needs. A smaller contingent opposes accepting more refugees, citing current domestic challenges, overcrowding, or the belief that other nations should provide support.
