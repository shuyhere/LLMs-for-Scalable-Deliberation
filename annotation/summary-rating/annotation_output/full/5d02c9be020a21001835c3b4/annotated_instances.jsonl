A common theme is the belief that the current private, for-profit system is failing, resulting in prohibitive costs, limited access, and poor health outcomes. Many supporters pointed to the successful implementation of universal healthcare in other developed nations as evidence that such a system is both feasible and desirable, arguing it would lead to a healthier, more equitable, and economically secure society.</p>\n<p>A small minority expressed opposition, primarily over concerns about government inefficiency, the high cost to taxpayers, and a preference for private sector solutions. A few commenters offered conditional support, advocating for a system that includes both public and private options or expressing concern that a government plan must guarantee timely and accessible care to be effective.</p>\n<p>Overall, the dominant perspective is that providing universal healthcare is a moral and practical imperative for the government to address the failures of the current system and ensure all citizens have access to necessary medical care.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 50s "}}
