The most common arguments in favor are rooted in compassion, with many stating that it is the \"right thing to do\" and that everyone deserves a safe place to live. Several people pointed to America's identity as a nation founded by those fleeing persecution and its capacity as a wealthy country to help others. Some also believe the U.S. has a particular obligation to accept refugees, especially when American foreign policy may have contributed to the instability in other nations.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently accompanied by significant conditions. The most prevalent condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out criminals. Many supporters also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to prevent a strain on national resources. The idea of a balanced approach was often mentioned, emphasizing that aid to refugees should not come at the expense of the well-being of current citizens.</p>\n<p>A smaller but distinct group of commentators opposes accepting more refugees. Their primary concern is focused on domestic issues, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens who are struggling. They believe that the country's resources, economy, and social systems are already strained and cannot support more people. Some also expressed that the number of people arriving is overwhelming and suggested that refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their homes.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reveal a central tension between the humanitarian desire to help people in life-threatening danger and pragmatic concerns about national security, economic capacity, and the needs of the existing population.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 29s "}}
