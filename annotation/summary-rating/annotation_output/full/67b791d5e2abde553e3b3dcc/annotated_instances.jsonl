Many commenters acknowledge the legitimacy of influencing as a real profession in today's digital age, recognizing that influencers provide entertainment, information, and product recommendations while earning a living doing what they enjoy. Several note the flexibility and convenience of the work, with some influencers achieving substantial income.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents view influencers as modern-day media figures who have replaced traditional news sources and celebrities. They're seen as more relatable and accessible than traditional celebrities, often sharing more of their personal lives and providing information not covered by mainstream media. Some appreciate how influencers shape trends and connect with audiences in unique ways.</p>\n<p>However, there are clear concerns about authenticity and originality. Critics find influencers annoying and question their genuineness, suggesting that followers are being misled. Others worry about the homogenization of content, noting that influencers tend to follow trends rather than being creative or unique, resulting in everyone promoting the same things.</p>\n<p>Overall, while not everyone personally relates to or would choose this career path, there's a general acceptance that influencing has become a legitimate profession suited to our social media-driven era. The role of influencers in modern society appears to be evolving from simple entertainment to encompassing education, news dissemination, and cultural influence, though questions about authenticity and responsibility remain important considerations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 4s "}}
