Many find it boosts productivity by handling routine or \u201cmeaningless\u201d tasks, speeding up work, streamlining workflows, and freeing time. It\u2019s widely valued for research support\u2014summarizing sources, surfacing key information, and helping learn technical topics\u2014sometimes described as akin to how search engines used to feel. Some note personal benefits such as aid in conflict reflection and general amusement. Older users highlight a smoother learning and idea-generation process compared with pre-digital methods. However, several caution that AI can be inaccurate, biased in source selection, or only \u201csometimes helpful,\u201d requiring fact-checking. For a subset, AI remains an optional tool that hasn\u2019t significantly changed their lives.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 13s "}}
