The majority of respondents oppose this measure, citing various concerns about privacy, freedom, and potential misuse of personal data.</p>\n<h6>Primary Concerns Against Real Identity Requirements</h6>\n<p>Privacy protection emerges as a central theme, with respondents emphasizing the importance of online anonymity. Many view anonymous participation as a fundamental freedom that enables open discussion without fear of real-world consequences. One participant specifically mentioned concerns about job security when expressing political views, while another highlighted the value of anonymous platforms like Reddit for information sharing.</p>\n<p>Data security and potential misuse represent significant worries.

One respondent distinguished between platform-initiated requirements (which they support) versus government mandates (which they oppose).
