A common theme is that such cuts are viewed as short-sighted and detrimental to education, research, innovation, and the nation's long-term competitiveness. Many commenters emphasize that education is foundational to society and express worry about reduced opportunities for students, the potential exodus of researchers, and the weakening of various fields, including critical areas like medical research. A small percentage of comments suggest there might be justifications for reductions, citing concerns about political bias in academia or the need to address wasteful spending, though these still acknowledge the importance of funding. Another minor segment admits to having insufficient information to form an opinion. Criticisms occasionally extend to characterizing the policy as authoritarian or motivated by a desire to limit public intelligence. The overarching conclusion is that investing in education is widely perceived as essential for future success.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 14s "}}
