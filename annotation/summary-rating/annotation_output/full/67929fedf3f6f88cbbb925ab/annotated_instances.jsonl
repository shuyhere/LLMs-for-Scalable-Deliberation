A majority of comments express opposition, primarily due to concerns over privacy and safety. These individuals argue that mandatory registration is an unnecessary intrusion that could expose users to risks like doxxing, harassment, stalking, or data being sold to third parties. Many also believe that anonymity is a fundamental freedom that protects marginalized groups, political dissidents, and those seeking sensitive information, such as victims of domestic abuse.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a significant portion of comments supports the idea, citing increased accountability as the primary benefit. Proponents believe that attaching real identities to online activity would reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, and inflammatory speech. They argue it would foster a more credible and responsible online environment.</p>\n<p>A smaller group expresses a nuanced or conditional view, suggesting a hybrid approach. Some propose that platforms should internally verify identities without displaying real names publicly, or that verification could be optional, granting verified users a badge. Others feel the requirement's merit depends on who is enforcing it, expressing more trust in platforms than in governments. A common concern across all positions is the risk of data breaches and the potential for companies to misuse the collected personal information.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
