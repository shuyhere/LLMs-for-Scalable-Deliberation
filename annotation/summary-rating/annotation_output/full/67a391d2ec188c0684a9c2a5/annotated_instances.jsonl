About half express unqualified support, while around one-third support it with conditions. Fewer than 20% oppose.</li>\n<li>Reasons for support: Emphasis on humanitarian duty, protecting lives, empathy (\u201cif I were in their shoes\u201d), alignment with American values and history, human rights and global solidarity, and in some cases acknowledgment of U.S. foreign policy responsibilities. Some also note potential benefits such as cultural diversity and revitalizing rural areas.</li>\n<li>Common conditions among supporters: Rigorous vetting and background checks; clear definitions of refugee status; exclusion of criminals and economic migrants; limits or caps to match capacity; ensuring minimal negative impacts on citizens\u2019 resources and the economy; and support for integration (civics education, skills training, strategic resettlement including less-populated areas).</li>\n<li>Concerns and opposition themes: Fiscal strain, debt, crowding, and pressure on social services; prioritizing citizens\u2019 needs first; perceptions of unfairness in benefits; preference that refugees seek protection in neighboring countries; and a view that the U.S. should accept only in extreme circumstances or when the economy can absorb newcomers.</li>\n<li>Points of convergence: Broad agreement on the need for careful vetting and clear eligibility criteria; many who are cautious still back limited or conditional acceptance. The core tension lies in balancing compassion and safety with resource management and economic impacts.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 16s "}}
