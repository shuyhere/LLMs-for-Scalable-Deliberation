Some also cited potential benefits such as cultural diversity, economic contribution, rural revitalization, and long\u2011term demographic needs.</li>\n<li>Conditional support: About 20% support acceptance with safeguards. Common conditions include rigorous vetting/background checks, excluding criminals, setting caps tied to capacity, ensuring minimal strain on public services/economy, clear legal processes (documentation, naturalization), integration support (education on laws, follow\u2011ups), geographic distribution (including rural placements), sharing responsibility with allies, and prioritizing the most vulnerable. A few suggested focusing on regions that receive less support.</li>\n<li>Opposition: About 18% oppose accepting more refugees, citing resource constraints, national debt, pressure on social systems, overwhelmed immigration infrastructure, and security/vetting concerns. Some argued neighboring countries should shoulder more responsibility or called for a pause until systems are fixed. A few expressed strong distrust of current policies and skepticism about the legitimacy of some asylum claims.</li>\n<li>Neutral/uncertain: About 2% were undecided, balancing sympathy for refugees with concerns about domestic capacity and social cohesion.</li>\n<li>Notable nuances:</li>\n<li>A small minority advocated very open policies (including abolishing borders), while others insisted on strict limits and enforcement.</li>\n<li>Several participants stressed humane treatment after arrival to avoid dehumanization, as well as clear public communication to reduce backlash.</li>\n<li>Some conflated refugees with broader undocumented immigration, which shaped concerns about legality and accountability.</li>\n<li>A few referenced Indigenous perspectives or historical context in framing their views.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the center of gravity favors accepting refugees, but many supporters want robust vetting, capacity\u2011based limits, and concrete integration plans to protect both refugees and host communities. Opponents prioritize focusing on domestic needs first and strengthening systems before any expansion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
