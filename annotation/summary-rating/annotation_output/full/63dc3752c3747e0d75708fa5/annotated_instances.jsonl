It is frequently described as an indispensable assistant that saves time by automating routine or mundane tasks, streamlining work, and accelerating research. Many users highlighted its role in enhancing creativity, such as assisting with art, writing, and generating new ideas. AI is also credited with providing quick access to information, offering emotional support, and improving various personal and professional skills.</p>\n<p>However, a substantial portion of comments also expressed significant concerns. Privacy emerged as a major issue, with many individuals feeling anxious about data collection and the potential for their personal information to be tracked and used without their knowledge. There is also a widespread sense of distrust, both in the information provided by AI, which often requires fact-checking, and in the content encountered online, with users becoming increasingly vigilant about AI-generated media, deepfakes, and a potential loss of originality. Concerns about job security due to automation were also prominently mentioned.</p>\n<p>A smaller segment of users reported that AI has not yet substantially changed their lives, viewing it as merely another optional tool or a form of entertainment, though some in this group anticipate greater future impact. The sentiment across all comments captures a tension between the excitement for AI's potential to enhance human capability and the apprehension regarding its ethical, social, and personal consequences.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}
