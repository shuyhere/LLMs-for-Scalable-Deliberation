A majority of comments express frustration with \"tipping fatigue,\" feeling pressured or bullied into tipping, especially through tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip on nearly every transaction. Many feel that tipping is being requested in inappropriate situations where little to no service is provided, such as for pickup orders, counter service, or drive-thrus.</p>\n<p>The most frequently cited cause for this issue is the practice of employers paying low, non-livable wages. Participants overwhelmingly believe that tipping has become a way for businesses to subsidize employee pay, shifting the financial responsibility from the employer to the consumer.</p>\n<p>The most popular proposed solution is to eliminate the reliance on tipping by requiring employers to pay their employees a fair, livable wage. In this model, tipping would return to its original purpose: a voluntary and optional reward for exceptional service, rather than a necessary component of a worker's income.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions for improvement include:\n*   Replacing discretionary tipping with a mandatory, fixed service charge, similar to systems in Europe or Japan.\n*   Modifying payment systems to make the \"no tip\" option more accessible and less uncomfortable to select.\n*   Restricting tipping requests to full-service environments like sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>While the system itself is heavily criticized, many individuals still feel compelled to tip, often generously. This is typically not out of support for the system, but out of a sense of obligation and empathy for underpaid service workers who rely on tips to make a living. A smaller portion of participants view tipping positively as a good incentive for employees to provide excellent service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
