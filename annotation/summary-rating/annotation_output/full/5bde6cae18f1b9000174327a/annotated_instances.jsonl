Many want tipping to be truly voluntary, requested only after service, and primarily tied to clear, meaningful service.\n- Strong support for employers paying a livable base wage so workers don\u2019t rely on tips. A significant share favors folding service costs into menu prices or using a transparent service charge, with tipping becoming optional or eliminated.\n- Preference for tipping based on service quality and personal affordability; several people oppose any expectation of tipping for minimal or no service (e.g., order pickup).\n- Reform ideas included: clearer POS interfaces with an easy, upfront \u201cno tip\u201d option; limiting tip requests to roles that provide direct service; standardizing suggested tip guidance to avoid manipulation; collecting tips only after service; and ensuring tipped workers receive at least minimum wage.\n- Minority views endorsed stronger pro-tipping norms (e.g., fixed-amount tips like $20\u2013$30, universal adoption, or compelled tipping) or policy tweaks like making tips tax-free.\n- A few suggested offering small acknowledgments or incentives for tipping (thank-you notes, coupons), while others argued for abolishing the system entirely in favor of fair wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 12s "}}
