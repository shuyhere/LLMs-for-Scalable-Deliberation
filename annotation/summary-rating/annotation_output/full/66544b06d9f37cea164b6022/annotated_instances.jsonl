A significant portion of the feedback centers on the belief that tipping should not be a way for employers to underpay workers. Over <strong>60%</strong> of the comments highlight the need for a <strong>living wage</strong> for service workers, suggesting that tipping should be <strong>optional</strong> or <strong>eliminated</strong> entirely when fair wages are ensured. Many argue that the tipping culture has become <strong>over-expected</strong>, <strong>invasive</strong>, or <strong>mandatory</strong>, especially in situations where service is minimal or non-existent (e.g., pickup orders, drive-thru, or self-service).</p>\n<p>A common concern is the <strong>intrusiveness of digital tipping systems</strong>, with <strong>over 30%</strong> of the comments criticizing the <strong>default suggested tips</strong> and the <strong>difficulty in declining to tip</strong> on point-of-sale devices. These systems are seen as pressuring customers to tip before or without receiving service.</p>\n<p>Some respondents support tipping when it is <strong>earned through quality service</strong>, but oppose it when it is <strong>expected for basic transactions</strong>. There is a general consensus that tipping should be a <strong>gesture of gratitude</strong>, not a <strong>financial obligation</strong>. A few suggest <strong>alternatives</strong> to the current system, such as <strong>flat service fees</strong> or <strong>fixed tip amounts</strong>, while others advocate for <strong>replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge</strong> to ensure fair compensation for workers.</p>\n<p>There is also a notable comparison to <strong>European systems</strong>, where <strong>fair wages are prioritized</strong> over tipping. Many argue that the U.S. tipping system is <strong>unique and outdated</strong>, and that <strong>employers should be held accountable</strong> for ensuring their workers are paid fairly.</p>\n<p>In summary, the tipping system is viewed by many as <strong>flawed and in need of reform</strong>, with a strong emphasis on <strong>fair wages</strong>, <strong>optional tipping</strong>, and <strong>eliminating pressure on customers to tip</strong> in inappropriate contexts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 52s "}}
