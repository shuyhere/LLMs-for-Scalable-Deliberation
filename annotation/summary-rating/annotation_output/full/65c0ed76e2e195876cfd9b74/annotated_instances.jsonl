Many feel it is a moral obligation to help those in life-threatening situations, putting themselves in the refugees' shoes and highlighting that everyone deserves a safe and good life. Some participants believe the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees, either due to its abundance of resources, its historical identity as a nation of immigrants, or as a way to atone for the impact of its foreign policy. The potential for cultural enrichment and revitalizing rural areas were also mentioned as benefits.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently accompanied by significant conditions. The most common stipulation is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Many also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negative impacts on the economy and to ensure that the quality of life for current citizens is not compromised by competition for resources.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters oppose accepting more refugees. Their primary concern is the strain on domestic resources, arguing that the government should prioritize its own citizens who are struggling before taking on more responsibility. These participants express concern that accepting more refugees diverts funds and services from Americans and places an unsustainable burden on the nation's systems and economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 26s "}}
