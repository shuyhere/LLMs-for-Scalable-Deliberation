Supporters prioritize curbing harm and inauthentic behavior, while opponents emphasize protecting users\u2014especially vulnerable groups\u2014from real-world risks and data misuse. Many favor flexible, privacy-preserving verification options over a blanket requirement.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_5": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 9s "}}
