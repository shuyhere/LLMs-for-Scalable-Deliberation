People use it to streamline work-related tasks, automate routine duties, and speed up processes like planning events or drafting professional communications. This has led to saved time, reduced struggle in the workplace, and more free time for personal pursuits.</p>\n<p>Another major benefit cited is AI's ability to act as a research and learning assistant. It is praised for quickly compiling and summarizing large amounts of information, making it easier to learn about new subjects, improve writing skills, and get answers without sifting through multiple sources. Some view it as a helpful tutor or a more advanced version of a search engine. AI is also seen as a catalyst for creativity and idea generation, with individuals using it to assist with creating art, brainstorming new concepts, and visualizing ideas.</p>\n<p>However, the feedback is not universally positive. A notable portion of comments express significant concerns. The most common anxieties revolve around privacy, with individuals worried about their personal data being collected and used without their knowledge. Other negative impacts mentioned include a growing distrust of online content, anxiety over job displacement, and ethical objections to AI. The accuracy and potential bias of AI-generated information are also pointed out as drawbacks that require users to fact-check its output.</p>\n<p>A smaller group feels that AI has not significantly changed their life, viewing it as just another optional tool rather than a transformative force.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 25s "}}
