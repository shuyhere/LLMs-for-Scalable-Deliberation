The prevalence of digital payment systems with automatic tip prompts is frequently cited as creating uncomfortable pressure to tip in inappropriate situations.</p>\n<h6>Preferred Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most commonly suggested improvement is eliminating tipping entirely in favor of employers paying living wages to their workers. Many respondents advocate for a system similar to European models where service workers receive fair base compensation without relying on tips. Some suggest implementing automatic service charges (typically around 10%) as an alternative to discretionary tipping.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on When Tipping is Appropriate</h6>\n<p>Among those who support some form of tipping, there's general agreement that tips should be:\n- Reserved for actual service provided (particularly sit-down restaurants)\n- Based on quality of service\n- Voluntary rather than mandatory or expected\n- Limited to situations where workers genuinely go \"above and beyond\"</p>\n<h6>Economic Considerations</h6>\n<p>Respondents frequently acknowledge the paradox of the current system: while they dislike tipping culture, they recognize that many workers depend on tips due to sub-minimum wages. Several mention the federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13/hour as problematic. There's widespread support for raising minimum wages to reduce worker dependence on tips.</p>\n<h6>Overall Sentiment</h6>\n<p>The prevailing sentiment is that the tipping system has become exploitative - both of customers who feel pressured to subsidize wages that employers should pay, and of workers who face income uncertainty. While most respondents continue to tip out of obligation or empathy for workers, they would prefer a system where fair wages eliminate the need for tipping altogether.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 4s "}}
