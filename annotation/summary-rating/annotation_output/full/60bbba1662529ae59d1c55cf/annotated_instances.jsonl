Roughly 75\u201380% express clear support, about 15\u201320% support it with conditions, and less than 10% oppose it outright.\n- Core reasons for support:\n  - Health care viewed as a human right and a government duty to ensure safety, well-being, and fairness.\n  - Affordability concerns: current costs are prohibitive, leading to medical debt and delayed or forgone care.\n  - Efficiency and outcomes: belief that a universal system (or large public pool) would lower costs, improve access, and produce better population health; skepticism toward for-profit insurers\u2019 incentives.\n  - International comparisons: other developed countries\u2019 universal systems cited as successful models (e.g., Canada), with calls to match or improve on their timeliness.\n  - Economic and societal benefits: healthier workforce, improved global competitiveness, and even national security considerations.\n- Conditional support themes:\n  - Preserve choice via a public option alongside private plans; avoid making government coverage the only option.\n  - Ensure timely access and quality to prevent long wait times.\n  - Limit scope to \u201cbasic\u201d coverage for all, with optional private upgrades.\n  - Concerns about privacy, monitoring, and government overreach; desire for streamlined, efficient administration.\n- Opposition themes:\n  - Preference for private-sector solutions, citing government inefficiency and risks to quality.\n  - Desire to reduce dependency on government programs.\n- Additional notes:\n  - Emphasis on equity across income, class, race, and employment status; some call for inclusion of dental care.\n  - Strong emotional concern about medical debt and the moral imperative to prevent avoidable suffering or death due to inability to pay.\n  - A view that redirecting priorities (e.g., relative to other federal spending) could enable universal coverage.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 46s "}}
