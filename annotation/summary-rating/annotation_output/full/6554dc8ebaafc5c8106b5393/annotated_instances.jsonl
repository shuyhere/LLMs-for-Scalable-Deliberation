Many express frustration, noting that frequent updates often feel unnecessary, driven more by profit motives than meaningful innovation. A significant percentage of commenters criticize planned obsolescence, citing shorter device lifespans, pressure to upgrade, increased electronic waste, and higher costs for minimal improvements. Common concerns include environmental harm, consumer manipulation, and the strain on personal finances.</p>\n<p>At the same time, a smaller portion acknowledges benefits such as improved security, performance, and technological progress. Some appreciate having access to cutting-edge features but suggest that innovation could be balanced with sustainability. Several propose longer update intervals\u2014such as every two to three years\u2014to reduce waste and allow for more substantial advancements.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward desire for a slower, more intentional cycle that values longevity, repairability, and meaningful upgrades over frequent, incremental releases.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 2s "}}
