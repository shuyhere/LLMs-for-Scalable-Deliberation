The most common criticism is that tipping allows employers to pay their employees a sub-standard or unlivable wage, unfairly shifting the financial responsibility to the customer. Many believe businesses should be required to pay their staff a fair, stable income so that workers do not have to rely on the inconsistency of tips.</p>\n<p>There is also widespread frustration with \"tip creep,\" the phenomenon of being asked to tip for services that traditionally did not involve tipping, such as counter service or takeout. Participants noted that modern point-of-sale tablets often create social pressure or awkwardness, making it difficult to decline a tip. The sentiment is that tipping has become over-expected and, in some cases, feels forced or mandatory rather than being a voluntary reward for good service.</p>\n<p>While the desire to abolish the system is strong, several alternative solutions were proposed. These include replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge, integrating the cost of service directly into menu prices, or changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts. A recurring theme is the desire to return tipping to its original purpose: a purely optional gesture of gratitude for exceptional service, not an obligation for basic transactions.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments expressed support for tipping as a way to reward workers who go above and beyond or to supplement the income of those in low-wage jobs. However, even among those who support the practice, there is a strong consensus that tips should be directly tied to the quality of service received and should not be expected for poor or minimal service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 28s "}}
