The most frequently cited worry is that tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers, as businesses pass on the additional costs. Many note that these price increases are already being felt and will disproportionately affect middle-class Americans and those already struggling economically. Several comments emphasize that tariffs effectively function as a tax on consumers rather than on foreign countries.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Economic Effects</strong></p>\n<p>Respondents are skeptical about the policy's ability to achieve its stated goals. Multiple comments point out that reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. is extremely difficult given the dismantling of domestic factories and supply chains over previous decades. Some note that companies are finding ways to circumvent the tariffs rather than bringing production back to America. Economic concerns include predictions of reduced GDP, lower wages, potential recession, and overall economic instability.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Several comments highlight concerns about deteriorating relationships with trading partners, particularly China.

Supporters believe the policy will help stabilize the economy by ensuring other countries pay their \"fair share\" and reduce U.S. debt. Some express hope that tariffs will encourage Americans to buy domestic products and eventually strengthen local industries.
