A significant portion of commenters believe the policy will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, while others see it as a positive and necessary change.</p>\n<p>Those who view the policy negatively express concerns about rising prices, inflation, and an increased cost of living for consumers. Some feel the tariffs disproportionately harm small businesses and benefit only the wealthy, without creating a significant number of jobs. Additional concerns include damage to international trade relationships, particularly with China, and the risk of other countries seeking alternative trade partners.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the policy believe it will have a positive effect. They argue that it corrects a long-standing trade imbalance where other countries were not paying adequate tariffs, thereby generating necessary revenue to stabilize the U.S. economy and budget. Some express trust in the long-term vision behind the policy, suggesting it will benefit the country in the future. There is also a sentiment that this policy rightly prioritizes the financial well-being of American workers, with the hope that it will help lift people out of poverty.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 29s "}}
