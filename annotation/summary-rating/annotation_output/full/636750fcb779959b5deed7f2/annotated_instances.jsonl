The most frequently cited reason is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many participants feel it is a moral and ethical responsibility of the government to ensure its citizens are cared for, arguing that no one should suffer or die due to an inability to afford medical care.</p>\n<p>A significant number of comments critique the current market-based system, describing it as prohibitively expensive, inefficient, and inaccessible, leading to poor health outcomes and financial ruin for many. Several participants pointed to the existence of universal healthcare in other developed nations as evidence that such a system is both feasible and beneficial, expressing frustration that the U.S. lags behind. The potential economic benefits of a healthier populace, such as increased global competitiveness, were also mentioned.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, some participants expressed nuanced or conditional views. A portion of supporters emphasized the importance of consumer choice, advocating for a public option that would exist alongside private insurance rather than replacing it entirely. Others conditioned their support on the quality and efficiency of the government-provided system, expressing concerns about potential wait times for care.</p>\n<p>A small minority of comments were in opposition to the proposal. These participants argued that the government is inherently inefficient and that healthcare quality would be better maintained in the private sector. Their reasoning also included a philosophical objection to increasing citizens' dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
