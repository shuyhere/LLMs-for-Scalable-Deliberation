Many still tip in practice but do so reluctantly, describing tipping as an \u201cunfortunate necessity.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wages vs. tips: Around three-quarters favor shifting pay responsibility to employers\u2014calling for a living wage, abolishing the subminimum tipped wage, or building compensation into menu prices\u2014so tipping becomes optional or reserved for exceptional service. A smaller group supports keeping or even strengthening tipping (e.g., higher standard rates, mandatory tips unless wages meet a threshold, or tax-free tips).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping is appropriate: There is broad agreement that tipping should be tied to clear, personal service (especially full-service restaurants and delivery). Many object to tips for counter service, pickup, minimal interaction, or being asked to tip before service is rendered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pressure and point-of-sale prompts: Many dislike tablet/iPad prompts and default high percentages, reporting social pressure and confusion. They want clearer \u201cno tip\u201d options, lower or customizable defaults, and prompts only after service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Basis for tipping: Most want tipping to reflect quality of service and to remain voluntary. Several note tip fatigue, financial constraints, and confusion about norms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proposed changes and alternatives:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Pay a guaranteed, livable base wage (often cited as at least federal minimum or $15/hour).</li>\n<li>Replace tips with a flat service charge (commonly 10%) or integrate service into prices.</li>\n<li>Limit who may solicit tips (primarily full-service dining and delivery).</li>\n<li>Ensure tipping occurs after service and is clearly optional.</li>\n<li>Improve POS design: easy \u201cno tip,\u201d lower or custom suggestions, reduce pre-service prompts.</li>\n<li>Other ideas raised by a minority: fixed-dollar tip norms, employer tip-matching, not taxing tips, or standardizing tip expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, most favor reducing reliance on tips by raising wages and narrowing where tips are requested, while preserving voluntary, quality-based tipping for genuine service. A smaller share prefers maintaining or formalizing tipping with clearer standards.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 20s "}}
