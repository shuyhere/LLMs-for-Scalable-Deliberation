They worry that funding cuts will harm students at all levels - from children to adults seeking further education.

Critics see the cuts as authoritarian tactics to control the population through reduced education, or as vengeful actions without proper understanding.

Some rely on academic study participation for income and fear the personal financial consequences.</p>\n<h3>Mixed or Conditional Views</h3>\n<p>A smaller percentage of respondents express more nuanced positions. Some acknowledge problems with current education systems while still opposing cuts. Others support reducing wasteful spending but worry about going too far.
