A strong majority of participants believe the policy will have, or is already having, a negative effect on the U.S. economy and society. The most common concern is that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumer goods, effectively acting as a tax on Americans. Many argued that companies pass the cost of tariffs directly to consumers, increasing the cost of living, fueling inflation, and disproportionately harming those who are already struggling financially. Several participants also expressed concern for small businesses that rely on imported goods, with some sharing personal experiences of their businesses being negatively affected.</p>\n<p>Further negative arguments included the potential for damage to international relations, leading to retaliatory tariffs from other nations and isolating the U.S. from global trade. Some viewed the policy as ineffective, stating that it would not succeed in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. and would only create economic instability and uncertainty.</p>\n<p>However, a smaller portion of participants expressed a positive outlook, viewing the tariffs as a necessary long-term strategy. Supporters argued that the policy levels an unfair global trade playing field, brings in revenue, and will ultimately protect and boost American industries by encouraging consumers to buy domestic goods. Several comments in this group acknowledged potential short-term negative effects, such as initial price increases, but believed these would be temporary and lead to a stronger economy in the long run. There was also a sentiment of trust in the administration's business acumen to secure a better future for the country.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more mixed perspective, acknowledging that the policy could have both positive and negative consequences, potentially protecting certain domestic industries while simultaneously raising costs for businesses and consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 45s "}}
