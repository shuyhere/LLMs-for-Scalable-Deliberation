The majority of participants believe it is a short-sighted and detrimental policy that harms the nation's future. Common concerns include that the cuts will limit opportunities for students, especially those who cannot afford higher education, and set up future generations for failure.</p>\n<p>Another major theme is the potential damage to research and innovation. Participants worry that reduced funding will slow progress in critical fields like medicine, cause top researchers to leave the country for better opportunities, and ultimately weaken the nation's long-term competitiveness. Some also attribute the cuts to a political motive, suggesting it is an authoritarian tactic designed to control the populace by limiting education and independent thinking.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of participants support or see some justification for the cuts. Their reasoning is primarily political, citing a belief that American academic institutions promote \"Marxist\" or \"nefarious leftist policies\" that warrant a reduction in funding.</p>\n<p>A few individuals expressed more neutral or ambivalent views. Some felt they lacked enough information to form an opinion, while others hoped the cuts might force a necessary overhaul of the education system. One participant expressed conditional concern, trusting there was a reason for the policy but worrying about the lack of an alternative solution.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
