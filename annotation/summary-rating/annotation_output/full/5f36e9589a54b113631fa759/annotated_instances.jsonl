Many highlight the failures of the current market-based system, citing issues such as high costs, limited access, and poor health outcomes. There is a frequent comparison to other countries, particularly those with universal healthcare systems, suggesting that such models are effective and equitable.</p>\n<p>Supporters argue that government-provided healthcare promotes public safety, reduces overall costs, and ensures that no one is denied care due to financial constraints. Some also frame healthcare as a national security and economic necessity, noting that healthy workers are essential for global competitiveness.</p>\n<p>A few commenters express conditional support, emphasizing the importance of choice and efficiency in the system. However, the overarching sentiment is that healthcare should be accessible to all and that the government has a responsibility to ensure this.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 1s "}}
