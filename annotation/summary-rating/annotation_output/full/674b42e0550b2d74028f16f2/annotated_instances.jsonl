A majority of the comments express strong support for government-provided healthcare, often framed as a human right and a necessary component of a functioning, fair, and healthy society. Supporters argue that healthcare should not be a privilege based on income or employment status, and that the U.S. lags behind other developed nations in this regard. Many highlight the current high cost of healthcare, the burden of medical debt, and the moral imperative to ensure access to care for all.</p>\n<p>Some emphasize the economic and social benefits of universal healthcare, including improved public health, reduced long-term costs, and the ability to focus on preventative care. Others reference the success of systems in other countries, such as Canada, and argue that the U.S. should follow suit. A common sentiment is that the government has a responsibility to care for its citizens, and that this includes ensuring access to basic healthcare.</p>\n<p>While the majority support government involvement in healthcare, a smaller percentage express concerns about the efficiency, cost, and potential negative impacts of a government-run system. Some worry about long wait times, reduced quality of care, and the inefficiency of government programs. Others oppose government control in principle, preferring private healthcare with more consumer choice. A few suggest a hybrid model, where a public option coexists with private insurance.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the idea that the U.S., as a wealthy and developed nation, should not allow its citizens to suffer or die due to lack of access to healthcare. Many commenters express frustration with the current system, noting that it is both expensive and inequitable. The moral, economic, and humanitarian arguments for universal healthcare are frequently cited, with many seeing it as a step toward a more just and functional society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 21s "}}
