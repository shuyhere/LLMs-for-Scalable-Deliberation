Supporters emphasize public health benefits, arguing that mandates protect communities through herd immunity, prevent widespread illness, and are grounded in scientific evidence. They often cite the greater good, collective safety, and the necessity of swift action during crises.</p>\n<p>Opponents raise concerns about bodily autonomy, distrust in government or pharmaceutical companies, and potential safety risks of rapidly developed vaccines. Some differentiate between quarantine (more accepted) and vaccination mandates (less accepted), citing ethical or constitutional objections. Skepticism focuses on government overreach, misinformation, and historical mishandling of epidemics.</p>\n<p>A minority express conditional support, advocating for measures only with transparency, proven vaccine safety, and severity-based justification. The discussion highlights tensions between individual rights and communal well-being, with trust in institutions and perceived epidemic severity being key factors shaping perspectives.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
