They argue that in a wealthy nation, ensuring basic health coverage for all citizens should be a core governmental responsibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Considerations</strong>\nSupporters highlight that the current private system is prohibitively expensive and inefficient. They note that universal healthcare could reduce overall costs through mandatory participation and elimination of profit-driven denial of care. Several mention the burden of medical debt and how people are forced to choose between healthcare and basic necessities.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nA recurring theme is that the United States lags behind other developed nations in healthcare provision. Respondents frequently reference countries like Canada and other \"first world\" nations that successfully implement universal healthcare systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>\nMany point to problems with the existing system, including lack of access, high costs, poor health outcomes, and the paradox of working people being unable to afford insurance. The inability of the free market to provide adequate healthcare as a social good is repeatedly emphasized.</p>\n<h6>Concerns and Opposition</h6>\n<p>A small minority express opposition or qualified support, citing:\n- Concerns about government inefficiency and quality of care\n- Worries about increased monitoring and loss of individual choice\n- Preference for reducing government dependency\n- Belief that private sector management ensures better quality</p>\n<h6>Conditional Support</h6>\n<p>Some respondents support a hybrid approach, advocating for:\n- A public option alongside private insurance choices\n- Basic coverage with timely care delivery\n- Limited government involvement focusing on essential services</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment strongly favors government intervention in healthcare, with most viewing it as both a moral imperative and a practical necessity for national competitiveness and public welfare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 54s "}}
