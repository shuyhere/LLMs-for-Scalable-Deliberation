The primary worry centers on increased consumer prices, as businesses pass tariff costs onto customers. Many noted that price increases are already observable, particularly affecting essential goods and making life more difficult for middle-class and lower-income Americans. Several participants characterized tariffs as essentially a \"tax on the people\" that disproportionately impacts consumers rather than foreign companies.</p>\n<p>Participants frequently mentioned that while tariffs aim to encourage domestic production, the U.S. lacks the immediate infrastructure and supply chains necessary for reshoring manufacturing. This transition period, they argue, will cause significant economic hardship before any potential benefits materialize.</p>\n<h6>Business and Trade Implications</h6>\n<p>Small businesses emerged as a particular concern, with multiple participants noting severe negative impacts on their operations. International trade disruptions were highlighted, including delayed or canceled shipments and strained relationships with trading partners. Some participants worried that retaliatory tariffs from other countries could further damage free trade and isolate the U.S. economically.</p>\n<h6>Support for the Policy</h6>\n<p>A smaller but notable portion of participants viewed the tariff policy positively. Supporters argued that tariffs address longstanding trade imbalances where other countries paid minimal tariffs to the U.S. They believe the policy will eventually stabilize the economy, protect domestic industries, and create American jobs. Some acknowledged short-term difficulties but maintained optimism about long-term benefits, suggesting that initial negative impacts are temporary sacrifices for future prosperity.</p>\n<h6>Mixed and Uncertain Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Several participants offered nuanced views, acknowledging both potential benefits and drawbacks. Some suggested that while tariffs might protect certain industries, the overall economic impact remains mixed or uncertain. A few participants noted that companies might find workarounds to the tariff policy, limiting its effectiveness.</p>\n<h6>Overall Assessment</h6>\n<p>The deliberation reflects significant skepticism about the current tariff policy, with most participants anticipating or already experiencing negative consequences through higher prices, business disruptions, and economic uncertainty. While supporters believe in eventual positive outcomes, the prevailing sentiment suggests immediate concerns outweigh potential long-term benefits. The discussion highlights a fundamental tension between protectionist goals and the practical challenges of implementing such policies in a globalized economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 17s "}}
