Roughly 85% oppose the cuts, about 7% support them, and the remainder express mixed or uncertain views.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key reasons for opposition:\n- Education as a foundation: Cuts are seen as undermining students\u2019 opportunities, social mobility, and the country\u2019s long\u2011term prosperity.\n- Innovation and competitiveness: Many warn of slowed research, weaker medical and scientific advances, and brain drain as researchers move abroad.\n- Economic and workforce impacts: Concerns about future skill gaps, reduced ROI from research, and diminished U.S. competitiveness.\n- Equity and access: Fears that low-income students will be hit hardest through reduced financial aid, larger class sizes, loss of arts/extracurriculars, and fewer resources in public schools.\n- National interest and governance: Some cite potential legal/process issues if funds were appropriated by Congress and argue that cuts work against national interests.\n- Perceived intent and politicization: A number believe the cuts are politically motivated, aimed at silencing or pressuring universities.</p>\n<p>Reasons offered in support or partial support:\n- Ideological and cultural concerns: Claims that academia is biased, engages in indoctrination, or misuses funds (e.g., DEI programs), so reductions are warranted.\n- Efficiency and reform: Arguments that federal involvement fuels tuition inflation and that funding should be trimmed, better targeted, or shifted to state/local control.\n- Fiscal prudence: Preference for eliminating waste, with some saying limited, reasonable cuts could drive needed reforms.</p>\n<p>Mixed/uncertain views:\n- Some request more details before forming an opinion.\n- A few suggest education needs an overhaul and believe cuts could be acceptable if paired with clear alternatives or safeguards.</p>\n<p>Commonly anticipated impacts:\n- Short-term: Program closures, job losses for educators/research staff, reduced research output, and immediate strain on students relying on aid or paid research roles.\n- Long-term: Slower innovation, reduced global standing, diminished economic growth, and persistent inequality.</p>\n<p>Suggested alternatives (implicit and explicit):\n- Prioritize investment in education and research while cutting waste elsewhere.\n- Pursue targeted reforms and accountability rather than broad cuts.\n- Maintain core funding for high-impact research and student support, even if restructuring other areas.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 19s "}}
