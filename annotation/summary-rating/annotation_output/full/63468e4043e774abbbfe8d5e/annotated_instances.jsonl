A common concern is that the policy is increasing prices for consumers and contributing to inflation, thereby raising the cost of everyday living. Many feel it is particularly harmful to small businesses and is straining international relationships as other countries seek alternative trading partners. A recurring sentiment is that the benefits are not felt by the majority of citizens and that the policy primarily serves the interests of the wealthy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial number of commentators voice strong support for the tariffs, anticipating a positive long-term impact on the U.S. economy. They argue that the policy is a necessary correction to previous trade imbalances, helping to stabilize the economy and reduce national debt by ensuring the U.S. receives adequate tariff revenues. Supporters express confidence in the business acumen behind the decision and believe that, despite short-term challenges, the strategy will ultimately help raise Americans out of poverty and strengthen the country's economic future. Some supporters also note that they have not personally observed the price increases mentioned by opponents.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
