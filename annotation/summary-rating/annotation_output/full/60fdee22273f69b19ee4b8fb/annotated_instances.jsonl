However, a significant portion supports it, and several others hold nuanced or conditional views.</p>\n<h6>Support for Real-Name Registration</h6>\n<p>Proponents of the requirement believe it would foster a safer and more responsible online environment. The primary argument is that linking real identities to online activity would increase accountability, leading to a reduction in harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Several supporters feel that the anonymity of the internet has enabled toxic behavior, and that real-name registration would compel people to act more civilly. Other reasons for support include curbing the creation of bots and fake accounts, protecting minors, preventing impersonation and catfishing, and assisting in investigations of malicious activity.</p>\n<h6>Opposition to Real-Name Registration</h6>\n<p>Opponents of the requirement raise strong concerns centered on privacy, safety, and freedom of expression. The most common argument is that it constitutes a significant invasion of privacy, forcing users to surrender personal information to tech companies they do not trust. Many fear this data could be misused, sold, or exposed in data breaches, leading to identity theft, fraud, and government surveillance.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, opponents argue that mandatory real names would endanger users by making them vulnerable to doxxing, stalking, and real-world harm from those who disagree with their opinions. This is seen as a particular risk for marginalized individuals, victims of abuse seeking anonymous support, and those with unpopular political views who could face professional repercussions. Many also cherish online anonymity as a right that allows for free and open expression without fear of reprisal. Some also question the effectiveness of such a policy, suggesting that determined individuals could still use stolen or fake identities.</p>\n<h6>Nuanced Perspectives and Alternative Solutions</h6>\n<p>A number of commenters see both the benefits and drawbacks of the proposal, offering conditional support or alternative solutions. A common middle-ground suggestion is to require real-name verification on the back end for the platform's records, while still allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym. This would enable platforms to identify and take action against bad actors without exposing every user's identity. Another suggested alternative is an optional verification system, where users who choose to register with their real identity receive a badge (e.g., a checkmark), allowing others to distinguish between anonymous and verified accounts without making it mandatory for all.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 12s "}}
