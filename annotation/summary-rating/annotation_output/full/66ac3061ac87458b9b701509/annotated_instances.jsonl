Many users report that AI has significantly improved their productivity and daily routines. However, a notable percentage express concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential for AI to contribute to job displacement. Some also mention anxiety regarding the authenticity of creative works and information accuracy, noting the need for fact-checking. While the majority view AI as a transformative and positive assistant, a smaller portion regard it as merely a useful tool without major life impact, and a few express strong reservations about its ethical implications.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 57s "}}
