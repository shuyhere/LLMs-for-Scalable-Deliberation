concerns about overcrowded cities and unfairness to struggling citizens.\n- A few strongly restrictive views (e.g., no more intake, or halt due to recent immigration levels).</p>\n<p>Notable minority views\n- One open-borders argument favoring total freedom of movement.\n- Calls to prioritize certain regions (e.g., African nations).\n- A Native American perspective affirming support while highlighting historical context.</p>\n<p>Areas of common ground\n- Even many supporters want strong vetting and measured intake.\n- Widespread emphasis on balancing compassion with capacity, maintaining public safety, and ensuring support systems keep pace.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 26s "}}
