Many emphasize that the United States, as a nation of immigrants or a wealthy country, has a responsibility to help those fleeing life-threatening situations like war and persecution.</p>\n<p>However, a common theme among supporters is the need for conditions, such as rigorous vetting processes to ensure security, limits on numbers to avoid straining resources, and efforts to integrate refugees into society. Some also mention that assistance should not come at the expense of existing citizens' well-being, highlighting concerns about economic strain, competition for resources, and overloaded public systems.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments oppose accepting more refugees, primarily citing domestic issues such as national debt, poverty among current citizens, and perceived strains on infrastructure and social services. Some express skepticism about the legitimacy of refugee claims or suggest that other countries should bear more responsibility.</p>\n<p>A few commenters note the role of U.S. foreign policy in creating refugee crises and argue that this imposes an additional obligation to help. Others emphasize the potential benefits of refugees, such as cultural diversity and economic contributions.</p>\n<p>In summary, while humanitarian support for refugees is prevalent, it is often tempered by practical concerns about security, economic impact, and equitable resource allocation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 4s "}}
