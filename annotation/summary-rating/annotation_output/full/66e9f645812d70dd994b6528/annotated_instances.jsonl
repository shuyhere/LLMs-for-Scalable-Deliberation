Many express frustration that establishments now request tips for minimal or no service, such as pickup orders, fast food transactions, and self-service situations. The proliferation of digital payment systems with built-in tip prompts has made declining tips uncomfortable and socially awkward.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Pressure on Consumers</strong>\nRespondents frequently mention feeling \"bullied,\" \"forced,\" or \"pressured\" into tipping, even when service quality doesn't warrant it. The expectation to tip has become a financial burden, with some noting that tipping makes everyday transactions more expensive and stressful.</p>\n<p><strong>Unfair Wage Structure</strong>\nA large percentage of comments highlight the fundamental issue of workers, particularly in food service, being paid below minimum wage and relying on tips for survival. Many view this as employers shifting their responsibility to pay fair wages onto customers.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p><strong>Eliminate Tipping Entirely</strong>\nThe most common suggestion is to abolish the tipping system completely. Respondents advocate for employers paying livable wages directly, removing the burden from customers and providing workers with stable income.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Reform</strong>\nMany propose raising the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour and ensuring all workers receive fair compensation without relying on tips. Some suggest implementing a mandatory service charge (commonly mentioned at 10%) that would be distributed to workers.</p>\n<p><strong>Limit Tipping Scope</strong>\nSeveral respondents suggest restricting tipping to traditional full-service situations, such as sit-down restaurants where servers provide extended service. They oppose tipping for counter service, takeout, or minimal interaction transactions.</p>\n<h6>Minority Perspectives</h6>\n<p>While the majority oppose the current system, a small percentage of respondents support tipping when it:\n- Rewards exceptional service\n- Provides workers with potential to earn above minimum wage\n- Serves as an incentive for quality service</p>\n<p>Some generous tippers express pride in their tipping practices while still acknowledging systemic problems.</p>\n<h6>International Comparisons</h6>\n<p>Several comments reference other countries' systems, particularly Europe and Japan, where tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing, suggesting these models as preferable alternatives to the American system.</p>\n<p>The overall consensus indicates strong dissatisfaction with the current tipping culture, with most respondents viewing it as an outdated system that unfairly burdens both workers and consumers while allowing employers to avoid paying fair wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 24s "}}
