A significant percentage of the comments view the practice as a profit-driven strategy by manufacturers that encourages unsustainable consumerism and planned obsolescence. This is seen as creating financial pressure on consumers to constantly upgrade, contributing to significant electronic waste, and resulting in products with only minimal, often unnoticeable, year-over-year improvements. Specific complaints include companies intentionally ending support for older devices, introducing buggy software updates, changing accessory standards like chargers, and a lack of easy repairability.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a smaller portion of the comments expresses appreciation for the rapid pace of innovation. These individuals view frequent updates as a sign of exciting technological progress, welcoming the regular improvements in performance, security, and features like better cameras. For some, the security aspect of software updates is seen as a necessary and reassuring benefit.</p>\n<p>Several comments strike a balanced tone, acknowledging both the benefits of new technology and the serious downsides of environmental impact and consumer pressure. A common suggestion is to move towards a more sustainable model, such as a longer, two-to-three-year cycle for major hardware releases, to better balance innovation with product longevity and environmental responsibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 48s "}}
