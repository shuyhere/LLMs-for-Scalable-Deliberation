The most frequently cited reason is the belief that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers. Many argued that companies will pass the increased costs of tariffs on to their customers, resulting in inflation, a higher cost of living, and reduced consumer spending, which could harm the overall economy and potentially lead to a recession. Several comments also expressed doubt that the policy would succeed in its goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., suggesting that companies would find it cheaper to absorb the cost or that the U.S. is not equipped to handle the manufacturing demand. Other negative points included damage to international relations, the risk of economic isolation, and the perception that the policy is poorly conceived and primarily benefits the wealthy.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments expressed a positive outlook on the tariff policy. These contributors believe the policy is a necessary step to correct unfair trade practices and stabilize the U.S. economy. The arguments in favor often focused on long-term benefits, suggesting that while there may be short-term challenges, the policy will ultimately strengthen the country, help American workers, and benefit the federal budget. Some voiced trust in the administration's business expertise to secure a better future for the country.</p>\n<p>A few comments presented a mixed or neutral perspective, noting that the policy could have both positive and negative effects\u2014simultaneously protecting some domestic industries while hurting consumers and creating economic uncertainty. One commenter suggested the policy might not have much of an impact at all, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 45s "}}
