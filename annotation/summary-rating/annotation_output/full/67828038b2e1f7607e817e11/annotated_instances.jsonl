Supporters cite protecting public health and the vulnerable, achieving herd immunity, ending outbreaks faster, and acting for the greater good. Roughly 10\u201315% of all comments voiced conditional support, emphasizing clear severity thresholds, proven vaccine safety and effectiveness, time-limited measures, equitable/free access, and strong public communication. A very small share (about 5%) favored strict penalties for noncompliance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mixed views: Around 10% support enforcing quarantine but oppose mandatory vaccination, arguing isolation is justified in emergencies while vaccination should remain a personal choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Opposition: About 25\u201330% oppose government enforcement (especially vaccine mandates). Key reasons include bodily autonomy and civil liberties, distrust in government competence and transparency, concerns about rapid vaccine development and potential side effects, and a preference for voluntary vaccination supported by education.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-cutting themes: Many referenced lessons from COVID-19, with both supporters and opponents using that experience to justify their stance. Across positions, commenters stressed the importance of evidence-based policy, transparency, public trust, proportionality, and clear off-ramps as conditions evolve. Tone ranged from measured to strongly ideological, reflecting significant polarization on the issue.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 43s "}}
