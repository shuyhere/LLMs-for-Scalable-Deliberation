They worry about exposure to stalking, harassment, doxxing, and real-world violence, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as domestic abuse survivors or those with unpopular political views. Several specifically mentioned concerns about job security if their personal views became publicly linked to their identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Security Issues</strong>: Respondents frequently expressed distrust of social media companies' ability to protect personal information. They cited risks of data breaches, hacking, identity theft, and companies potentially selling user data to third parties or government entities.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Many believe anonymity is fundamental to free speech online, allowing people to express themselves without fear of retribution. They argue that forced identification would stifle open discourse and marginalize those who need anonymous platforms for support or community.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Enforcement Challenges</strong>: Several respondents questioned how such a system could be effectively implemented without intrusive ID verification processes, and noted that determined bad actors would find ways to circumvent the requirements.</p>\n<h6>Support for Real-Name Registration</h6>\n<p>Those favoring real-name registration primarily focused on accountability and safety benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Reducing Harmful Behavior</strong>: Supporters believe real identities would decrease cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. They argue that people behave more responsibly when their actions are tied to their real identity.</p>\n<p><strong>Protecting Minors</strong>: Some respondents see real-name verification as a way to protect children from predators and prevent adults from impersonating minors.</p>\n<p><strong>Combating Bots and Fake Accounts</strong>: Several supporters view this measure as effective for reducing bot accounts and preventing impersonation.</p>\n<p><strong>Building Trust</strong>: A few respondents believe real names enhance credibility and authenticity in online interactions.</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Some respondents proposed compromise approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making real-name registration optional with verification badges for those who choose to verify</li>\n<li>Requiring real names for platform registration but allowing pseudonyms for public display</li>\n<li>Supporting platform-level requirements while opposing government mandates</li>\n<li>Implementing real-name requirements only for specific types of accounts or platforms</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Key Themes</h6>\n<p>The discussion reveals tension between competing values of safety and privacy, with respondents weighing the potential for reduced online harm against risks to personal security and freedom of expression. Many expressed particular concern about the concentration of personal data in the hands of tech companies they don't trust. The comments also reflect broader anxieties about online safety, data security, and the evolving nature of digital identity in an increasingly connected world.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 51s "}}
