The predominant concern is that this action will undermine the foundation of society by limiting opportunities for students, stifling innovation, and weakening America's long-term global competitiveness. Many commenters describe the cuts as short-sighted and dangerous, arguing they will harm public schools, increase social inequality, and drive talented researchers to other countries. A common theme is that education is a public good essential for a functioning democracy and a strong economy, and defunding it is characterized as an authoritarian tactic to create a less informed populace.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments express support for the funding cuts.
