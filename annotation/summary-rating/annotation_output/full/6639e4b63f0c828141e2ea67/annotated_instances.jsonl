Many frame this as a moral and humanitarian duty, emphasize safety and human rights, and note America\u2019s identity as a nation of immigrants. Some add that the U.S. bears responsibility for conflicts abroad and should show global leadership and solidarity. A few cite potential cultural and economic benefits and propose resettling in underpopulated or rural areas.\n- About one-fifth are opposed, prioritizing domestic needs first. They cite resource strain, debt, pressure on public services and housing, concerns about crime or inadequate screening, and argue refugees should seek safety in neighboring countries. Some call for pausing admissions until systems are fixed.\n- A small share are undecided or conflicted, balancing compassion with worries about capacity, social cohesion, and fairness to citizens.</p>\n<p>Common conditions and guardrails among supporters\n- Rigorous vetting/background checks; exclusion of individuals with criminal histories or security risks.\n- Clear limits or caps tied to capacity, ensuring minimal impact on citizens\u2019 quality of life and the economy.\n- Distinguishing \u201cgenuine\u201d refugees from economic migrants; transparent eligibility standards.\n- Strong integration supports: education on laws and norms, documentation and follow-up, job/skills training, and pathways to legal status or clear timelines.\n- Coordinated burden-sharing: work with allies, distribute arrivals across communities, and consider priority for regions seen as underserved or for crises linked to U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Recurring concerns across perspectives\n- Strain on resources and services, housing, and local infrastructure.\n- Integrity of the immigration/refugee system and the need to prevent abuse.\n- Balancing compassion with domestic priorities and maintaining public confidence through transparency and enforcement.</p>\n<p>Notable outliers\n- A few advocate for open borders or abolition of borders altogether.\n- A small number express strong skepticism about the U.S. as a destination or raise issues about how refugees might later be treated.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 44s "}}
