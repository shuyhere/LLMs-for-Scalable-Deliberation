A notable subset (around 20%) supports it conditionally, emphasizing choice, timeliness, or limiting it to essential services.\n- Reasons for support: Health care framed as a human right and a core government responsibility; widespread concerns about affordability, access, and medical debt; desire to prevent avoidable illness and death; belief that universal coverage improves population health, economic productivity, and even national security; references to successful models in other developed countries; skepticism of for\u2011profit insurers\u2019 incentives; expectation that broad participation lowers costs through risk pooling.\n- Preferred designs: Universal basic coverage for all, with several advocating a public option alongside private plans to preserve choice; emphasis on timely, efficient, high\u2011quality care; some callouts for including dental and chronic disease management; interest in ensuring taxpayers benefit.\n- Concerns and conditions: Opponents cite government inefficiency, quality risks, and the principle that \u201cnothing is free,\u201d preferring private-sector solutions. Even among supporters, there are cautions about wait times, bureaucracy, and potential government overreach or monitoring; some only back a scaled-down, basic package.\n- Tone and experiences: Many describe personal or observed hardship due to high insurance costs and fear of medical debt. Comparisons with Canada and other nations are frequent, along with appeals to fairness and dignity and occasional calls to reprioritize national spending toward health care.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_1": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}
