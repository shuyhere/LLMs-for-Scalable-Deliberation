Many commenters advocate for mandatory mental health evaluations by a qualified professional for all prospective gun owners. The primary concern is that allowing individuals with certain mental health conditions, particularly severe illnesses or those with a history of violence, to own guns increases the risk of harm to both themselves and others. The potential for guns to make acts of violence more lethal was a recurring theme.</p>\n<p>However, there are also notable counter-arguments and concerns. Some feel that banning gun ownership based on a mental health diagnosis is discriminatory and could set a precedent for restricting the rights of other marginalized groups. The practical difficulty of implementing such a policy was also raised, given that many individuals with mental health issues are not formally diagnosed. Furthermore, some comments highlight the need for nuance, arguing that not all mental health conditions are the same and that a diagnosis like anxiety, for example, does not automatically make a person a danger.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
