A significant portion of the input emphasizes the importance of mental health evaluations as part of the gun purchasing process. Many argue that individuals with severe mental illness, particularly those with a history of violence or self-harm, should not be allowed to own firearms due to the increased risk to themselves and others. Others stress the need for a nuanced approach, suggesting that gun ownership restrictions should depend on the type and severity of the mental illness, rather than applying a blanket ban. </p>\n<p>Some contributors express concern about the potential for overreach or discrimination, noting that broad definitions of mental illness could lead to stigmatization and the unjust removal of gun rights from individuals who do not pose a threat. There is also a recognition that enforcing such regulations could be challenging, particularly with the diversity of mental health conditions and the difficulty of accurate diagnosis.</p>\n<p>A number of comments support stricter gun control overall, not limited to mental health considerations, and some argue for a complete ban on private gun ownership. Others emphasize the importance of balancing individual rights with public safety, suggesting that mental health should be one of many factors considered in gun policy. A few voices also raise concerns that linking mental illness to gun ownership could discourage people from seeking mental health care for fear of losing their rights.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion highlights a complex interplay between public safety, individual rights, and the challenges of implementing effective and fair policies that address both mental health and gun control.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
