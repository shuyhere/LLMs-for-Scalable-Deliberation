Many argue that combining guns with certain mental health conditions poses a serious risk to both the individual and public safety. There is notable agreement on the need for comprehensive background checks that include evaluations by qualified mental health professionals.</p>\n<p>However, a substantial number of comments raise concerns about implementing such a policy. A recurring issue is the broad and undefined nature of the term \"mental illness,\" with many arguing that a blanket ban would be discriminatory and ineffective. Instead, there is a call for a more nuanced, case-by-case approach that considers the type and severity of the condition. Some fear that a poorly defined policy could discourage people from seeking mental health treatment or could be used to discriminate against other marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>Practical challenges are also highlighted, with doubts about how such a rule would be enforced and how to accurately identify individuals who pose a genuine risk. A minority of comments argue against any private gun ownership altogether, regardless of mental health status.</p>\n<p>In summary, while there is a consensus on the need for smarter gun regulations and the consideration of mental health, the comments largely favor a precise, well-defined policy over a broad ban, emphasizing individual assessment and the avoidance of stigmatization.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
