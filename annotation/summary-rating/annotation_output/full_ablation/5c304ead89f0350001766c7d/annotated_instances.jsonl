Many highlighted the potential danger to both the individuals themselves and to society at large, with specific references to school shootings and the effectiveness of firearms as weapons. Several participants viewed the combination of mental illness and gun access as inherently dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Screening and Evaluation</strong>: There was considerable support for implementing mental health evaluations as part of the gun purchase process. Suggestions ranged from simple background checks to comprehensive evaluations by qualified mental health professionals. Some proposed that individuals with a history of severe mental illness should obtain clearance from a mental health professional before being permitted to purchase firearms.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Restrictions</strong>: Multiple comments distinguished between different types of mental health conditions and behaviors. Several participants specifically supported restrictions for those diagnosed with severe mental illness or those with a documented history of violence or concerning behaviors, rather than blanket bans on all individuals with any mental health diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Challenges</strong>: Practical concerns were raised about the feasibility of enforcement, particularly noting that many individuals with mental health conditions remain undiagnosed, which would make any screening system incomplete.</p>\n<p><strong>Discrimination Concerns</strong>: A minority perspective argued that restricting gun ownership based solely on mental health diagnoses constitutes discrimination, suggesting that such policies unfairly stigmatize individuals with mental health conditions.</p>\n<p>The comments reveal a complex debate balancing public safety concerns with individual rights and the challenges of implementing fair and effective policies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
