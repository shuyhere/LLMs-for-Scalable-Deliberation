There are also worries about a slippery slope of rights removal for other marginalized groups.\n- Practical and ethical concerns include feasibility of accurate diagnosis, privacy, due process, potential stigma, and the risk of false positives/negatives in mental health assessments.\n- Some call for broader gun-control measures beyond mental health criteria and urge evidence-based policy, recommending data collection from jurisdictions that have implemented bans or evaluations to determine effectiveness and refine approaches.</p>\n<p>In short, the discussion favors stronger, evidence-informed safeguards linking gun access to mental health and violence risk, while emphasizing the need to avoid stigmatization, protect rights, and ensure practicable, fair implementation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
