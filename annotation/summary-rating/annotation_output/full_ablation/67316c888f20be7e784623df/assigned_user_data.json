Some view the combination of mental health conditions and gun ownership as inherently dangerous, arguing that mental illness can manifest through violence and that access to firearms could exacerbate these risks. The effectiveness of guns as tools of violence is noted as a particular concern.</p>\n<p><strong>Discrimination and Rights Concerns</strong>\nA notable subset of comments raises concerns about discrimination and civil rights.
