A significant portion emphasizes the importance of mental health evaluations as part of the gun purchasing process. Many suggest that individuals with severe mental illness should not be allowed to own firearms, citing the increased risk of harm to themselves and others. Others argue that mental health should be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than applying a blanket ban.</p>\n<p>Some commenters express concern that banning guns for individuals with mental illness could lead to broader discrimination or erosion of gun rights for other groups. There is also discussion around the practicality and enforceability of such policies, with some questioning how effectively these rules could be implemented.</p>\n<p>A number of voices advocate for stricter gun control overall, not just for individuals with mental illness, and suggest that all gun buyers should undergo thorough background checks and mental health assessments. A smaller but notable percentage argue for a complete ban on gun ownership for all individuals, regardless of mental health status.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments highlight a complex interplay between public safety, individual rights, and the challenges of implementing effective and fair gun control policies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
