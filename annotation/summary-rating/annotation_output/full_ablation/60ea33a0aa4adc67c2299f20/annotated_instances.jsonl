Many comments emphasize the increased risk of harm, both to the individual and the public, when guns are accessible to people in such circumstances. A recurring suggestion is the implementation of mandatory mental health evaluations or clearance from a licensed professional as a prerequisite for purchasing a firearm.</p>\n<p>However, a significant concern is raised about the potential for discrimination. Some argue that banning gun ownership based solely on a mental illness diagnosis is unfair and could be a slippery slope, leading to the rights of other marginalized groups being infringed upon. This perspective highlights the need for careful, nuanced policies that distinguish between different types and severities of mental health conditions.</p>\n<p>The comments also reflect a desire for evidence-based policy, suggesting that data from jurisdictions with existing bans should be analyzed. While there is strong support for smarter regulations and background checks, the overarching theme is a call for a balanced approach that enhances public safety without enacting blanket discrimination.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
