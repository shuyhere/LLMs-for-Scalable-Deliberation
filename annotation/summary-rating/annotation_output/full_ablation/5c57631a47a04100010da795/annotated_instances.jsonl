Many argue that guns can amplify the risk of harm to both the individual and society when in the hands of someone with untreated or severe mental illness. Some suggest that <strong>mandatory mental health evaluations or clearances from qualified professionals</strong> should be required before purchasing a firearm, especially for those with a history of mental health concerns.</p>\n<p>There is also discussion about the <strong>challenges of enforcing such regulations</strong>, particularly due to the difficulty of diagnosing mental illness and the potential for <strong>overreach or discrimination</strong>. Some express concern that policies targeting mental illness could lead to broader government control over gun rights, potentially affecting other groups. Others emphasize the need for <strong>evidence-based decision-making</strong>, suggesting that data from regions with existing bans should be studied before implementing new laws.</p>\n<p>A few comments highlight the <strong>nuance of mental health</strong>, noting that not all individuals with mental health conditions are dangerous and that blanket bans could be unjust. There is also general support for <strong>tighter gun control measures</strong> and <strong>smarter regulations</strong> to reduce gun-related violence, especially in schools and public spaces.</p>\n<p>In summary, the comments reflect a consensus that mental health should be a key consideration in gun policy, but with differing views on how to balance public safety, individual rights, and the complexities of mental health diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
