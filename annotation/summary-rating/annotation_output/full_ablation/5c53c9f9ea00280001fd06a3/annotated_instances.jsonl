A significant portion of the feedback expresses strong support for restricting firearm access for individuals with mental health conditions, citing increased risks of harm to themselves or others. Many argue that guns are particularly dangerous in the hands of someone whose judgment may be impaired.</p>\n<p>However, a substantial number of comments emphasize that \"mental illness\" is an overly broad and poorly defined category. These contributors caution against a blanket ban, arguing that it would be discriminatory and ineffective. Instead, they frequently advocate for a more nuanced, case-by-case approach. This perspective suggests that restrictions should be based on the specific type and severity of the illness, particularly focusing on conditions linked to violence or hallucinations, rather than stigmatizing all diagnosed individuals.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the call for mandatory, professional mental health evaluations as part of the gun purchasing process. Many see this as a more equitable and effective solution than an outright ban. At the same time, there is notable concern about the practical challenges of implementation, including how to define mental illness for such a policy and how to enforce it without discouraging people from seeking mental health care.</p>\n<p>Finally, a distinct viewpoint present in the comments argues for universal gun control measures that apply to everyone, irrespective of mental health status. Some contributors express the belief that private gun ownership should be banned entirely to enhance public safety.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
