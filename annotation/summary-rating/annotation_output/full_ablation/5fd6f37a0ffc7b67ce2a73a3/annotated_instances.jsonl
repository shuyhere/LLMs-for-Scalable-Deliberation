A smaller share advocate banning guns for everyone, irrespective of mental status, while a few emphasize individual responsibility and rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Targeted restrictions vs. blanket bans: There is strong preference for targeted restrictions focused on severe mental illness, documented histories of violence, suicidality, or active symptoms such as psychosis/hallucinations. Many oppose a blanket ban on all people with any mental health diagnosis, noting the breadth of the term \u201cmental illness\u201d and the need for case-by-case assessments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Screening and clearance: Frequent calls for universal background checks plus mental health evaluations, ideally conducted by licensed professionals. Some suggest mandatory clearance specifically when there is a history of severe mental illness or violence. Others recommend mental health checks for all purchasers, not only those with diagnoses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation challenges: Concerns include undiagnosed conditions, feasibility and cost of enforcement, defining \u201csevere\u201d or \u201cdangerous,\u201d protecting privacy, avoiding false positives/negatives, and establishing clear due process and appeals. There is also worry that linking gun rights to diagnosis could deter people from seeking mental health care.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equity and discrimination: Some argue that banning gun ownership based on mental illness is discriminatory and risks expanding to other marginalized groups. Many therefore stress precise definitions and individualized evaluations to minimize bias.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Safety rationale and counterpoints: Supporters of restrictions cite elevated risks of harm to self and others, including suicide and mass violence, when firearms are accessible. A minority counter that determined individuals might cause harm regardless of gun access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional ideas: Calls to gather and use evidence from jurisdictions that have implemented similar policies; limit certain firearm types; require training and other safety mandates; and ensure that post-evaluation, mental illness is not used as an \u201cexcuse\u201d after a crime.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: The comments lean toward stronger, evidence-informed gun regulations that integrate mental health screening and targeted prohibitions for high-risk individuals, while emphasizing clear definitions, due process, and practical, non-discriminatory implementation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
