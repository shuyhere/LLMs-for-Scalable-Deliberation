Many emphasize the importance of <strong>mental health evaluations</strong> as part of the gun purchasing process, particularly for individuals with a <strong>history of severe mental illness or violence</strong>. Supporters of such measures argue that these steps could help <strong>prevent harm to individuals and society</strong>, reduce <strong>self-harm risks</strong>, and <strong>improve public safety</strong>.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some express concerns about <strong>discrimination</strong>, noting that broad restrictions based on mental health could <strong>stigmatize individuals</strong> and <strong>lead to overreach by the government</strong>, potentially extending to other marginalized groups. Others argue for <strong>case-by-case assessments</strong> rather than <strong>blanket bans</strong>, highlighting the <strong>complexity and variability</strong> of mental health conditions.</p>\n<p>There is also significant support for <strong>stricter gun control overall</strong>, with some advocating for <strong>banning guns for all individuals</strong>, regardless of mental health status. Concerns about <strong>enforcement challenges</strong> are also mentioned, with some questioning the <strong>practicality and fairness</strong> of implementing such policies.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion centers on balancing <strong>public safety</strong>, <strong>individual rights</strong>, and <strong>the nuances of mental health</strong> in the context of gun ownership.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
