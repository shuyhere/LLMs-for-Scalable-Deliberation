Many suggest requiring clearance from licensed mental health professionals, with some specifically calling for \"deep mental health evaluations\" alongside background checks. Several commenters believe that severe mental illness, particularly when combined with a history of violence, should disqualify individuals from gun ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Discrimination</strong>\nMultiple participants express concern that targeting people with mental illness for gun restrictions is discriminatory. Some worry this could set a precedent for removing gun rights from other marginalized groups. Others point out that mental illness exists on a spectrum, with comments noting that conditions like anxiety shouldn't automatically disqualify someone from gun ownership.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Challenges</strong>\nPractical concerns about enforcement emerge throughout the comments. Participants note that many people with mental illness remain undiagnosed, making any mental health-based restrictions difficult to implement effectively. Questions about how such policies would be enforced and monitored are raised.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Gun Control Perspectives</strong>\nThe comments also reflect a wider debate about gun control in general. Some participants advocate for complete gun bans regardless of mental health status, while others focus on reducing the types of firearms available to all civilians. Several comments emphasize the need for \"stricter gun laws\" and \"smarter regulations\" beyond just mental health considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Case-by-Case Assessment</strong>\nA notable theme is the preference for individualized assessment rather than blanket policies. Multiple commenters suggest that mental health conditions should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the severity of the condition and any history of violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Evidence-Based Approach</strong>\nSome participants call for examining data from jurisdictions where similar restrictions have been implemented to inform policy decisions, suggesting a desire for evidence-based rather than purely ideological approaches to this issue.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
