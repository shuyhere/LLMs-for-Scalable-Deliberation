The primary motivation for this view is the belief that allowing individuals with certain mental health conditions to own guns poses an increased risk of harm to both themselves, through suicide, and to society at large.</p>\n<p>However, this support is highly nuanced. A large number of commenters caution against a \"blanket ban\" based on any mental illness diagnosis. They argue that \"mental illness\" is a broad spectrum and that any regulation should depend on specific factors such as the type and severity of the illness. Many believe the focus should be on severe conditions that impair judgment or are linked to a history of violence, rather than common conditions like anxiety or depression. The idea of a case-by-case assessment is frequently preferred over a categorical prohibition.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some participants raise concerns about the practicality and fairness of such a policy. They point out the difficulty of enforcement, especially with undiagnosed individuals, and warn that it could lead to discrimination and stigmatization. A key concern is that linking gun ownership to mental health diagnoses might discourage people from seeking necessary mental healthcare for fear of losing their rights.</p>\n<p>Finally, a notable portion of the comments expresses the view that focusing on mental illness is insufficient. These individuals advocate for much stricter gun control for everyone, or for a complete ban on private gun ownership, arguing that firearms are inherently dangerous regardless of the owner's mental state.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
