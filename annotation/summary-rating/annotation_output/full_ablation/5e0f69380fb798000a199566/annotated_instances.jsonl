Many argue that individuals with severe mental illness, particularly those with a history of violence, should not be permitted to purchase guns due to the increased risk of harm to themselves and others. Several commenters emphasize the importance of mental health evaluations as part of the gun purchasing process, suggesting that a qualified mental health professional should be involved in assessing suitability for gun ownership.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some commenters challenge the idea of banning gun ownership for individuals with mental illness, arguing that such a policy could be discriminatory or lead to broader government overreach. A few suggest that decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis rather than applying a blanket ban. Others advocate for broader gun control measures that apply to all individuals, not just those with mental health conditions, emphasizing that guns are inherently dangerous tools that should be more strictly regulated.</p>\n<p>There is also discussion around the practicality and enforceability of such regulations, with some questioning how mental health checks would be effectively implemented and monitored.
