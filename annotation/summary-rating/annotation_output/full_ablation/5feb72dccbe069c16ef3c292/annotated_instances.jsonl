Many participants believe that individuals with a severe mental illness, particularly those with a history of violence, should face restrictions or be prohibited from owning guns. The most common proposal is to require a comprehensive mental health evaluation by a qualified professional for all potential gun buyers, in addition to background checks. The reasoning often cited is the increased risk of harm to both the individual, through suicide, and to society at large.</p>\n<p>However, there are significant concerns and counterarguments. Some view a ban based on mental health status as discriminatory, arguing that it unfairly targets a specific group and could lead to a \"slippery slope\" of restricting rights for other marginalized populations. Others question the practicality of such a policy, pointing out that many individuals with mental illness are undiagnosed, which would make enforcement difficult.</p>\n<p>The discussion also highlights the need for a nuanced approach rather than a blanket ban. Several comments distinguish between different types and severities of mental illness, suggesting that conditions like anxiety should not automatically disqualify someone from gun ownership. This leads to the idea of assessing individuals on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Finally, a portion of the comments expresses a broader desire for stricter gun control, with some advocating for a complete ban on firearms for the general public, regardless of mental health status.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
