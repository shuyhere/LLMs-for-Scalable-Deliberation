Many support the idea of mandatory mental health evaluations conducted by qualified professionals as a prerequisite for gun ownership. However, a significant concern is raised about the practicality and fairness of such policies; some argue that enforcement would be difficult due to undiagnosed conditions, while others view a blanket ban as discriminatory against people with mental health diagnoses. The underlying sentiment is that while guns are tools, their potential for harm necessitates preventative measures that carefully balance public safety with the rights of individuals.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
