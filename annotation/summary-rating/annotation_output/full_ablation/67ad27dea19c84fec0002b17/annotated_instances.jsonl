A significant portion of the feedback emphasizes the importance of mental health evaluations as part of the gun ownership process. Many suggest that requiring a mental health evaluation or clearance from a qualified professional could help prevent dangerous situations, particularly for individuals with a history of severe mental illness or concerning behaviors.</p>\n<p>Some contributors argue that individuals with mental health conditions should not be allowed to own firearms, citing the potential risk to themselves and others. Others caution against broad stigmatization, noting that not all individuals with mental illness are a danger and that many are not even diagnosed. A few commenters express concern that banning guns solely based on a mental health diagnosis could be discriminatory.</p>\n<p>Overall, there is a general consensus that mental health should be considered in gun policy, with a preference for targeted, professional evaluations rather than sweeping restrictions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
