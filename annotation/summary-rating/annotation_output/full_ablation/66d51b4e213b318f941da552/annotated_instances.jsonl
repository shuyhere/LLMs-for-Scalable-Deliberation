Many suggest that a mandatory mental health evaluation conducted by a qualified professional should be a prerequisite for gun ownership. This is often seen as a practical and necessary measure to enhance public safety, particularly in contexts like school shootings.</p>\n<p>However, a contrasting view cautions that such policies could be discriminatory against people with mental health conditions. Some also point out practical challenges, noting that a significant number of individuals with mental illness may remain undiagnosed, which could limit the effectiveness of any rule based solely on a formal diagnosis. There is a specific emphasis that restrictions should be strongly considered for those with a documented history of violence or other concerning behaviors.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
