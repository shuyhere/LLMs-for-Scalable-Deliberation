Most support integrating mental health safeguards into gun ownership\u2014ranging from universal mental health evaluations and robust background checks to requiring clearance from qualified professionals, especially when there is a history of severe mental illness. There is debate over the scope of restrictions: some favor categorical bans for severe mental illness, while others argue limits should focus on histories of violence or concerning behavior to avoid discrimination against all diagnosed individuals. A recurring practical concern is that many people with mental illness are undiagnosed, which could make enforcement difficult and potentially unfair if only diagnosed individuals face restrictions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
