Many suggest comprehensive background checks combined with assessments from qualified mental health professionals. Some propose that clearance from licensed doctors should be mandatory, particularly for those with histories of severe mental illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Safety</strong>\nMultiple comments emphasize safety concerns, citing risks to both individuals with mental health conditions and the broader community. Participants express worries about increased likelihood of self-harm and potential violence. Several note that the combination of mental illness and gun access creates dangerous situations, with some specifically mentioning school shootings and the effectiveness of firearms as tools of violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to Blanket Bans</strong>\nA notable percentage of respondents oppose blanket restrictions, arguing that such policies would be discriminatory. Some participants share personal experiences, such as having anxiety while not considering themselves dangerous. Others advocate for case-by-case assessments rather than categorical exclusions based solely on mental health diagnoses.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Challenges</strong>\nSeveral comments highlight practical concerns about enforcement. Participants note that many individuals with mental illness remain undiagnosed, making effective implementation difficult. Questions arise about how such regulations would be monitored and enforced in practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Gun Control Perspectives</strong>\nBeyond mental health-specific restrictions, many comments advocate for stricter gun control measures overall. Some participants support complete gun bans regardless of mental health status, while others suggest limiting the types of firearms available to all citizens. A few emphasize the need to examine data from jurisdictions with existing restrictions before implementing new policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Nuanced Approaches</strong>\nSeveral participants propose more nuanced criteria, such as focusing on individuals with both mental illness and histories of violence rather than mental illness alone. Others emphasize the importance of considering the severity and type of mental health condition when making determinations about gun ownership eligibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
