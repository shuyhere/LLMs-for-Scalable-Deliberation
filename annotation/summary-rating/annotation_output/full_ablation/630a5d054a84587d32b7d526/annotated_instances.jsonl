Many support universal background checks, mandatory training, and adding mental health evaluations by qualified professionals before purchase.\n- Strong support for focusing restrictions on severe or high-risk conditions and, especially, on individuals with a documented history of violence, threats, or dangerous behavior. Several call for case-by-case assessments rather than a blanket ban on all people with any mental health diagnosis.\n- Repeated concerns about definitions and implementation: \u201cmental illness\u201d is a broad term, and commenters want clear, specific criteria that distinguish non-violent conditions (e.g., anxiety, ADHD) from psychosis, violent ideation, or instability. Some suggest requiring clearance from a licensed clinician and periodic reviews.\n- Rights, stigma, and equity issues are flagged. Banning only those diagnosed could be discriminatory, may miss undiagnosed people, and might deter individuals from seeking care. There\u2019s also worry about scope creep to other marginalized groups and about privacy.\n- Practical challenges are emphasized: how to enforce a diagnosis-based ban, limited detection of undiagnosed conditions, potential false positives/negatives, and who decides \u201cseverity.\u201d Some propose data-driven evaluation using evidence from jurisdictions that have implemented similar policies.\n- Public safety rationale is prominent: access to firearms may elevate risks of suicide and harm to others among some individuals with mental illness; several argue that guns are uniquely lethal and that safeguarding schools and communities requires stronger controls overall.\n- Minority perspectives include calls to ban civilian gun ownership altogether, as well as skepticism that a mental-illness-focused ban would reduce harm because determined individuals might use other means.</p>\n<p>Emerging direction:\n- Favor tighter, universal measures (background checks, training, safe storage) combined with targeted, behavior- and risk-based restrictions tied to clearly defined severe conditions and histories of violence.\n- Implement mental health evaluations by qualified professionals with due process, privacy protections, and periodic reassessment.\n- Monitor for unintended consequences (deterring treatment, discrimination) and refine policy based on empirical outcomes from pilot programs and existing jurisdictions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
