A significant portion of the feedback advocates for mandatory mental health evaluations conducted by qualified professionals as a prerequisite for gun ownership. This is seen as a necessary measure to improve public safety, especially in contexts like school shootings.</p>\n<p>However, a contrasting viewpoint is also present, which argues that such bans are discriminatory. This perspective suggests that a diagnosis alone should not be grounds for prohibition, highlighting concerns about fairness and the potential for stigma.</p>\n<p>A practical challenge noted is the difficulty of enforcement, given that a considerable percentage of people with mental health conditions may be undiagnosed. Overall, the primary theme is the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes safety through professional evaluation while acknowledging the complexities of implementation and concerns about discrimination.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
