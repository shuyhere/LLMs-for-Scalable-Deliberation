The primary motivation is to prevent harm to both the individual and society, particularly in the context of mass shootings and suicide.</p>\n<p>However, this support is highly nuanced. A significant portion of commenters argue against a blanket ban for anyone with a mental illness, emphasizing that \"mental illness\" is a very broad term. They call for clear definitions and a case-by-case approach that distinguishes between severe conditions involving violence or psychosis and more common conditions like anxiety. Several suggest that restrictions should specifically target individuals with a combined history of severe mental illness and violent behavior.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there are notable concerns and counterarguments. Some participants believe such a policy would be discriminatory and could create a \"slippery slope\" leading to the restriction of rights for other marginalized groups. Others raise practical challenges, questioning how such a rule could be enforced, especially since many individuals with mental illness are undiagnosed. A key concern is the potential for unintended consequences, where people might avoid seeking necessary mental health treatment for fear of losing their right to own a gun.</p>\n<p>Finally, a portion of the comments express a desire for broader gun control, with some advocating for a complete ban on gun ownership for the general public, irrespective of mental health status.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
