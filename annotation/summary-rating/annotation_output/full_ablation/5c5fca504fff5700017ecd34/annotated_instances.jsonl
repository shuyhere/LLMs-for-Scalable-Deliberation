A significant portion of comments strongly supports prohibiting firearm access for individuals with severe mental illness, arguing it is a necessary measure to reduce the risk of harm to both the individuals themselves and the broader public. Many advocate for mandatory, in-depth background checks and mental health evaluations conducted by licensed professionals as a prerequisite for gun ownership.</p>\n<p>However, another perspective emphasizes the need for a nuanced, case-by-case assessment rather than a blanket ban, expressing concern that such a prohibition could be discriminatory. Some individuals with personal experience of mental illness, such as anxiety, argued that a diagnosis does not automatically make someone a danger. There is also a degree of skepticism regarding the practicality and potential overreach of such regulations, with concerns about enforcement difficulties and the possibility of rights being stripped from other groups.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments argue for broader gun control measures that apply to everyone, irrespective of mental health status, with some advocating for a ban on public firearm ownership entirely. Finally, some contributors call for evidence-based policymaking, suggesting that data from jurisdictions with existing bans should be analyzed to inform effective regulations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
