A significant portion of the comments express strong support for restricting firearm access for individuals with mental health conditions, citing increased risks of harm to themselves and others. There is recurring emphasis on the need for comprehensive background checks and mandatory mental health evaluations conducted by qualified professionals as a prerequisite for gun ownership.</p>\n<p>However, a substantial number of comments voice significant concerns about a blanket ban. These concerns center on the potential for discrimination, the broad and undefined nature of the term \"mental illness,\" and the fear that such policies might discourage people from seeking mental health services. Many suggest that any restrictions should be applied on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific diagnosis, its severity, and the individual's history, particularly concerning violent behavior.</p>\n<p>The comments also reveal a broader debate about gun control itself, with some participants arguing for universal bans or stricter regulations for all citizens, irrespective of mental health status. Practical challenges, such as the difficulty of enforcement and the need for clear, data-driven definitions, are also highlighted as critical considerations for any proposed policy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
