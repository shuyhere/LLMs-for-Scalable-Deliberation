Common suggestions include requiring evaluations from qualified mental health professionals, implementing comprehensive background checks, and obtaining clearance from licensed doctors. Several comments emphasize that severe mental illness combined with gun access poses risks to both individuals and society. There's particular support for restrictions when someone has a history of both mental illness and violence.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Discrimination and Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents raise concerns about potential discrimination. Some worry that blanket bans based on mental health diagnoses would be discriminatory and could lead to broader marginalization of various groups. Others point out practical challenges, noting that many people with mental health conditions remain undiagnosed, making enforcement difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>Nuanced Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>Several comments offer more nuanced views. Some participants distinguish between different types and severities of mental health conditions, suggesting that not all mental health diagnoses should result in gun restrictions. One commenter shares personal experience with anxiety, noting they wouldn't consider themselves dangerous if they chose to own a gun. Others emphasize the need for data-driven approaches and studying jurisdictions where similar measures have been implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and Safety Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the comments, there's recurring emphasis on public safety concerns, including references to school shootings, the risk of self-harm, and the potential for violence when mental health crises occur. Many view guns as particularly effective tools of violence that require careful regulation, while others stress the importance of balanced, evidence-based approaches to any restrictions.</p>\n<p>The overall discussion reveals tension between public safety concerns and individual rights, with participants seeking solutions that address both effectively.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
