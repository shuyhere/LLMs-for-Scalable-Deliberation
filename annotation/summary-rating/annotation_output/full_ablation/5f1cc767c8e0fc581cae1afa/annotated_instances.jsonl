Many argue that individuals with severe mental illness, particularly those with a history of violence, should be prohibited from purchasing firearms or should be required to obtain clearance from a mental health professional. This view is often based on the concern that guns in the hands of mentally ill individuals increase the risk of harm to both themselves and the public. Some suggest that comprehensive background checks and mental health screenings should be a universal requirement for all gun purchases, not just for those with a known history.</p>\n<p>Conversely, another perspective raises concerns about discrimination and feasibility. Some comments argue that a blanket ban on gun ownership for people with mental illness is discriminatory and could set a precedent for disarming other marginalized groups. Others question how such a rule could be effectively enforced, pointing out that many people with mental health issues are undiagnosed. This viewpoint often advocates for a more nuanced, case-by-case assessment rather than a broad prohibition.</p>\n<p>A third, distinct group of comments advocates for broader gun control measures that apply to everyone, irrespective of mental health status. This includes calls for banning certain types of firearms, implementing stricter universal gun laws, or even advocating for a general ban on public firearm ownership. The underlying sentiment here is that guns themselves pose a significant risk to society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
