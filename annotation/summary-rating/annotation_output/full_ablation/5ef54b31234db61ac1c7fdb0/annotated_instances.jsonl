Within that, a large share favors incorporating mental health safeguards into firearm purchasing.</li>\n<li>Many advocate case-by-case assessments rather than a blanket ban tied to any mental health diagnosis. They emphasize severity, type of condition (e.g., psychosis, violent ideation, severe impairment), and documented history of violence or self-harm as key criteria.</li>\n<li>A notable contingent argues for banning or heavily restricting guns for everyone, irrespective of mental health status.</li>\n<li>A smaller but clear perspective warns that targeting \u201cmental illness\u201d is overly broad, risks discrimination and stigma, conflates mental illness with violence, and may deter people from seeking care.</li>\n<li>Common implementation ideas include: universal background checks; mandatory mental health evaluations by licensed professionals; clinician clearance for those with severe or relevant histories; strengthened, standardized definitions of \u201cmental illness\u201d in law; better data systems (while protecting privacy) to flag high-risk cases; and broader measures such as limiting gun types, training, and stricter licensing.</li>\n<li>Key concerns: practical enforceability given underdiagnosis; unclear or overly broad definitions; privacy and due process; potential government overreach; creation of loopholes (illegal purchases); and the risk that focusing on mental illness alone won\u2019t significantly reduce gun violence.</li>\n<li>Rationales cited for restrictions include preventing suicide and impulsive or violent acts where access to a gun escalates harm. Others counter that those intent on harm may find alternate means and that mental illness does not equate to dangerousness.</li>\n<li>Areas of potential common ground: clearer, narrower criteria tied to demonstrable risk; professional evaluations for high-risk cases; stronger universal background checks; and data-driven policymaking that balances safety with civil liberties.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
