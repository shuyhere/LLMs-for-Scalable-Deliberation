Many believe that individuals with severe mental illness should not be permitted to own firearms, citing safety concerns for both the individual and society. Several commenters specifically advocate for mandatory mental health evaluations conducted by licensed professionals before any gun purchase. Some suggest that clearance from a mental health professional should be required, particularly for those with a history of severe mental illness.</p>\n<h3>Concerns About Implementation and Discrimination</h3>\n<p>Multiple participants raised practical concerns about enforcement, noting that many people with mental illness remain undiagnosed, making any such policy difficult to implement effectively. There are also strong concerns about discrimination, with some viewing mental health-based gun restrictions as unfairly targeting one group. One commenter warned that such discrimination could extend to other marginalized groups over time.</p>\n<h3>Nuanced Approaches</h3>\n<p>Several respondents favor more nuanced approaches rather than blanket bans. Some suggest that assessments should be conducted on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the severity and type of mental illness. Others propose that a combination of mental illness history AND violent behavior should be the criteria for restriction, rather than mental illness alone. One participant with anxiety specifically noted they wouldn't consider themselves dangerous if they chose to own a gun.</p>\n<h3>Broader Gun Control Perspectives</h3>\n<p>A notable segment of comments extends beyond the mental health question to advocate for broader gun control measures. Some participants believe guns should be banned for everyone regardless of mental health status, while others call for stricter regulations on the types of firearms available to the general public.
