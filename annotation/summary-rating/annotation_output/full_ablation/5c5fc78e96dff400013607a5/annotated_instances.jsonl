The most frequently suggested measure is requiring all potential gun buyers to undergo a mandatory mental health evaluation or clearance from a qualified professional. Many believe that individuals diagnosed with a \"severe\" mental illness should not be permitted to own guns, citing the increased risk of harm to both themselves and society.</p>\n<p>However, there is considerable nuance within this majority view. Several commentators advocate for a case-by-case assessment rather than a blanket ban for anyone with a mental health diagnosis. They suggest that restrictions should focus on the severity of the illness or be limited to individuals with a documented history of violence in addition to a mental health condition. One personal account from an individual with anxiety highlights the belief that not all mental health conditions should be treated the same.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments express broader views on gun control, with some advocating for a complete ban on firearms for the general public, regardless of mental status.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some participants raise significant concerns about restrictions based on mental health. The primary objections are that such policies would be discriminatory against those with mental illness and could create a \"slippery slope\" leading to the infringement of rights for other groups. Practical challenges to enforcement were also noted, particularly the difficulty of identifying individuals with undiagnosed mental health conditions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
