A significant portion emphasizes the potential dangers of allowing individuals with mental health conditions to possess firearms, citing increased risks of harm to themselves and others. Many suggest that mental health evaluations, particularly for those with a history of severe mental illness or violence, should be a prerequisite for gun ownership. The idea of requiring clearance from a qualified mental health professional is frequently mentioned as a practical and effective measure.</p>\n<p>Some comments express concern that banning guns solely based on a mental health diagnosis could lead to discrimination or overreach, with fears that marginalized groups beyond those with mental illness might also lose their rights. Others argue that such bans are necessary, especially for individuals with a history of violent behavior. There is also a call for more data and research from regions that have implemented similar policies to guide future decisions.</p>\n<p>While many advocate for tighter gun control and more thoughtful regulation, there is also a recognition that mental illness is often underdiagnosed, making enforcement of such rules complex. A few voices highlight the importance of distinguishing between mental illness and violence, suggesting that while gun access should be restricted for those with a history of violent acts, it should not be entirely denied to all individuals with mental health conditions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
