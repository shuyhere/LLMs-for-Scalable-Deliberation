Many suggest that background checks should include mandatory, in-depth mental health evaluations conducted by licensed professionals, with some emphasizing that this should apply to all potential gun buyers, not just those with known issues.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of comments voice opposition to blanket bans, arguing that such policies are discriminatory and fail to account for the vast spectrum of mental health conditions. These comments often advocate for assessments on a case-by-case basis, suggesting that a history of violence, rather than a diagnosis alone, should be the primary factor in determining eligibility.</p>\n<p>There is also a recurring theme of practical concern regarding implementation. Some comments question the feasibility of enforcing such rules, pointing to challenges like undiagnosed individuals and the potential for government overreach that could marginalize other groups.</p>\n<p>Finally, a distinct perspective calls for broader gun control measures that apply to the entire population, such as banning certain types of firearms or implementing universal prohibitions, irrespective of an individual's mental health status.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
