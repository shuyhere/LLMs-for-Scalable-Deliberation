Many argue that requiring mental health evaluations or background checks could help prevent gun-related harm without imposing a blanket ban.</p>\n<p>Some contributors express concern that a broad ban on gun ownership for people with mental illness could be discriminatory or lead to overreach by the government, potentially infringing on the rights of individuals who are not a danger to themselves or others. There is also recognition that mental illness is a broad and complex term, and that not all conditions pose the same level of risk.
