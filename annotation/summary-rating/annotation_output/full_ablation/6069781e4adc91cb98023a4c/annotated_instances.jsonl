A significant portion of comments express concern that individuals with severe mental illnesses, especially those with a history of violence, should not have access to firearms due to increased risks of harm to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>However, some comments caution against discriminatory policies, arguing that a diagnosis alone should not automatically disqualify someone. A minority of comments emphasize the difficulty of enforcement due to undiagnosed conditions and warn against potential government overreach impacting marginalized groups beyond those with mental illness. A recurring theme is the call for evidence-based regulations, with suggestions to study existing bans.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
