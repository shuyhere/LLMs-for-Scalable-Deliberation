A significant percentage of commentators believe that allowing individuals with certain mental health conditions to possess firearms poses a serious risk of harm to both themselves and the wider community, viewing the combination as a \"deadly mix.\"</p>\n<p>The most frequently proposed solution is a requirement for a mental health evaluation or clearance from a qualified professional before a person can purchase a gun. However, many nuanced this position, suggesting that restrictions should specifically target individuals diagnosed with \"severe\" or \"extreme\" mental illnesses, or those who have a history of violence in addition to a mental health condition. One participant distinguished between conditions like anxiety and more severe illnesses, arguing against a blanket ban that would affect all diagnoses equally.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a portion of the comments raised strong objections to these proposals, citing concerns about discrimination. These participants argued that banning guns based on a mental illness diagnosis is unfair and could lead to a \"slippery slope\" where the rights of other marginalized groups are also restricted. Practical challenges were also highlighted, with one person noting the difficulty of enforcing such a rule since many people with mental health issues are undiagnosed.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
