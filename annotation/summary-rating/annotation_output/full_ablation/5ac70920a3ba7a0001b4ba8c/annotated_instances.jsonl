The primary motivation for this view is public safety, with commenters frequently noting that allowing individuals with certain mental health conditions to own guns increases the risk of harm to both themselves and others.</p>\n<p>However, this support is highly nuanced. Many participants cautioned against a blanket ban, arguing that restrictions should be based on specific criteria rather than a general diagnosis. The most commonly cited factors were the <strong>severity</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of the illness, with a clear distinction made between conditions like anxiety and those involving psychosis or violent ideation. A frequently mentioned condition was that restrictions should apply specifically to individuals with a documented <strong>history of violence</strong> in addition to a mental illness diagnosis. Several people advocated for a case-by-case assessment rather than a one-size-fits-all policy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some participants raised significant concerns about policies linking mental health to gun rights. These concerns included the potential for <strong>discrimination</strong> against a marginalized group and the practical <strong>difficulty of enforcement</strong>, given that many individuals are not formally diagnosed. A key worry was that such a policy could create a stigma that <strong>discourages people from seeking mental health care</strong> for fear of losing their rights.</p>\n<p>A portion of the comments expressed broader views on gun control, with some stating that gun laws should be stricter for everyone or that firearms should be banned for the general public entirely, regardless of mental status.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
