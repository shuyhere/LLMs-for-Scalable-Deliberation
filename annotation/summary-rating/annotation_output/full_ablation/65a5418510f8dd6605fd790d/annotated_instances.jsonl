A significant portion of commentators support the idea of restricting firearm access for individuals with mental health conditions, frequently suggesting that mandatory mental health evaluations should be part of the purchasing process. Many argue that this is a necessary safety measure to prevent harm to the individual or the public, with some specifying that the policy should focus on severe illnesses, particularly those associated with violence or hallucinations.</p>\n<p>However, a contrasting perspective emphasizes the potential for discrimination and the impracticality of such a policy. These comments caution against a blanket ban, arguing that the term \"mental illness\" is too broad and that such a policy could discourage people from seeking help. Instead, they advocate for a more nuanced, case-by-case assessment. A smaller percentage of comments argue for universal gun restrictions, believing that the general public should not have access to firearms regardless of mental health status. Overall, while there is strong support for some form of mental health consideration in gun control, there is considerable debate over how to define the criteria and implement the policy fairly and effectively.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
