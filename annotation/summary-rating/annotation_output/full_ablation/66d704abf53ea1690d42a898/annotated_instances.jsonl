Some commenters believe that anyone diagnosed with a severe mental illness should not be permitted to own a gun, viewing the combination as a \"deadly mix.\"</p>\n<p>Specific proposals include requiring a deep mental health evaluation from a qualified professional for all potential gun buyers, or more targeted approaches like requiring clearance for those with a history of severe mental illness. Another suggestion is to focus restrictions on individuals who have both a mental health diagnosis and a history of violence.</p>\n<p>However, some concerns were raised. One commenter pointed out that banning guns for individuals with a mental illness diagnosis could be discriminatory. Another noted a significant practical challenge: many people with mental illness are undiagnosed, which would make enforcing such a rule difficult.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
