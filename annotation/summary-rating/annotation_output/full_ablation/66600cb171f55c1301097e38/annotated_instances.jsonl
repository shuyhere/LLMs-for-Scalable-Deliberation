A significant portion of the feedback supports the idea of requiring mental health evaluations or background checks for gun ownership, particularly for individuals with a history of severe mental illness or violence. Many argue that such assessments would help prevent harm to both the individual and society, especially in cases where mental illness is linked to violent behavior.</p>\n<p>However, there is also concern about the potential for overreach and discrimination. Some commenters caution that labeling all individuals with mental illness as a threat could lead to unfair restrictions and discourage people from seeking mental health care. There is a recurring call for more nuanced approaches, such as case-by-case evaluations or defining \"mental illness\" more clearly to avoid a one-size-fits-all policy.</p>\n<p>A smaller but notable group of comments advocate for a complete ban on gun ownership for all individuals, regardless of mental health status, while others believe that gun control should extend beyond mental illness to include broader restrictions on gun types and availability.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward the importance of mental health considerations in gun policy, with a preference for balanced, evidence-based measures that address risks without infringing on rights unnecessarily.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
