Many suggest that background checks should include evaluations by qualified mental health professionals. There's strong support for screening procedures that would identify individuals who might pose risks to themselves or others.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Broad Definitions</strong>\nA recurring theme is that \"mental illness\" is too broad a category to serve as a blanket restriction. Respondents frequently note that mental health conditions exist on a spectrum, with vast differences between conditions like anxiety or ADHD and more severe disorders involving psychosis or violent tendencies. Many argue for case-by-case assessments rather than categorical bans.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Gun Control Advocacy</strong>\nA notable segment believes guns should be banned for everyone, regardless of mental health status. These respondents view gun control as a broader societal issue that transcends mental health considerations.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation and Discrimination Concerns</strong>\nSeveral practical concerns emerge around enforcement and potential discrimination. Respondents worry that mental health-based restrictions could:\n- Discourage people from seeking mental health treatment\n- Be difficult to implement given many mental illnesses go undiagnosed\n- Lead to discrimination against marginalized groups\n- Be exploited to disarm law-abiding citizens</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Assessment Focus</strong>\nMany comments emphasize that the primary concern should be risk of violence or self-harm, not mental illness per se. Respondents frequently suggest that factors like history of violence, severity of symptoms, and specific diagnoses should guide decisions rather than any mental health diagnosis automatically disqualifying someone.</p>\n<p><strong>Spectrum of Restrictions</strong>\nThe comments reflect varying degrees of proposed restrictions, from complete bans for those with severe mental illness to more nuanced approaches considering the type and severity of conditions. There's particular concern about conditions involving hallucinations, severe depression, or histories of violence.</p>\n<p>Overall, while there's considerable support for incorporating mental health considerations into gun ownership decisions, the comments reveal significant disagreement about how to implement such measures fairly and effectively.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
