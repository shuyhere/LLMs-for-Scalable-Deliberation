Common criteria suggested include the type and severity of the condition, documented risk factors (e.g., history of violence, suicidal behavior, hallucinations), and professional clearance attesting the individual is not a danger to self or others.\n- A substantial share argues that people with severe or high\u2011risk mental illnesses should be restricted or denied access to firearms, especially where there is a history of violence or self-harm. Several emphasize suicide risk reduction as a key rationale.\n- A notable contingent opposes targeting mental illness specifically, citing that \u201cmental illness\u201d is too broad, risks stigmatization and discrimination, is often underdiagnosed (making enforcement difficult), and could deter people from seeking care. Some fear slippery-slope expansions to other groups or general disarmament.\n- A smaller but vocal group calls for banning or severely limiting civilian gun ownership altogether, independent of mental health status.\n- Practical concerns include feasibility and fairness of enforcement, defining \u201csevere\u201d mental illness, ensuring due process and appeal rights, protecting medical privacy, avoiding false positives/negatives, and preventing misuse of a mental health database.\n- Some are skeptical that mental illness\u2013based restrictions would meaningfully reduce gun violence, noting that determined individuals may use illegal channels or other means, and that mental illness is only one of multiple contributing factors.\n- Implementation ideas mentioned: standardized and narrowly defined eligibility criteria; professional evaluations with periodic re-assessment; integration of medical and criminal background checks; limits on firearm types available to the public; national but privacy-conscious risk reporting systems; and data-driven policymaking based on results from jurisdictions that have tried such measures.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
