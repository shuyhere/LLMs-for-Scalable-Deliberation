A frequently expressed view is that all potential gun buyers should be required to undergo a thorough mental health evaluation by a qualified professional. Many believe that individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness, particularly those with a history of violence, should not be permitted to own firearms, citing the increased risk of harm to both themselves and others.</p>\n<p>However, some participants raised concerns that banning guns based on a mental health diagnosis is discriminatory and could lead to a \"slippery slope\" of restricting rights for other groups. A more nuanced perspective suggested that mental illness is a spectrum, and individuals should be assessed on a case-by-case basis rather than being subjected to a blanket ban.</p>\n<p>Practical challenges to enforcement were also a key concern, with some pointing out that many individuals with mental health conditions are undiagnosed, making such a rule difficult to implement.</p>\n<p>Beyond the specific link to mental health, a notable portion of comments advocated for broader gun control measures for the entire population, ranging from restricting certain types of weapons to banning civilian gun ownership altogether.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
