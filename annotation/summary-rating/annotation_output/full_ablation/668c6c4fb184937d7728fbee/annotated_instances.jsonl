The effectiveness of guns in violent acts, such as school shootings, is a significant underlying concern.</p>\n<p>Proposals range from universal requirements, such as mandatory mental health evaluations for all potential gun buyers, to more targeted approaches. These include requiring clearance from a mental health professional for those with a history of severe mental illness or banning firearms for those diagnosed with a severe condition, particularly when combined with a history of violence.</p>\n<p>However, some counterpoints and practical challenges are raised. One view is that banning guns based solely on a mental health diagnosis is discriminatory. Another significant concern is the difficulty of enforcement, as many individuals with mental health conditions are not formally diagnosed, which could undermine the effectiveness of such a policy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
