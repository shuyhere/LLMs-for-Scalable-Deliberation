Many commenters argued that allowing individuals with certain mental health issues to own guns poses a significant risk of harm to both themselves and others, viewing the combination as a potential \"deadly mix.\" Proposals ranged from requiring a mental health evaluation for all potential gun buyers to more targeted restrictions for those with a diagnosed severe mental illness or a history of violence.</p>\n<p>However, significant concerns were raised about discrimination. Some participants argued that banning gun ownership based on a mental illness diagnosis is unfair and could set a precedent for taking rights away from other marginalized groups. This perspective highlighted that not all mental health conditions are the same, with one commenter noting their own anxiety would not make them a danger.</p>\n<p>Practical challenges to implementing such policies were also noted. For example, it was pointed out that many individuals with mental illness are not formally diagnosed, which would make enforcement difficult. A more nuanced position suggested that while a history of mental illness and violence should make it harder to obtain a gun, it should not be an automatic disqualifier. Overall, the comments reflect a central tension between the desire to enhance public safety through stricter regulations and concerns about discrimination and the rights of individuals.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
