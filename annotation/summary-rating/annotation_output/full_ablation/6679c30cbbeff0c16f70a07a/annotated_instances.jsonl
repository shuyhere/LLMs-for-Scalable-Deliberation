Many view this as a reasonable safety measure that could prevent harm to both individuals and society.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Defining \"Mental Illness\"</strong>\nMultiple participants emphasized that \"mental illness\" is too broad a term, encompassing conditions ranging from anxiety and ADD to severe psychotic disorders. Many argued for case-by-case assessments rather than blanket restrictions, with particular focus on:\n- History of violence or violent ideation\n- Severity and type of mental health condition\n- Specific symptoms like hallucinations or extreme instability</p>\n<p><strong>Discrimination and Implementation Concerns</strong>\nSeveral respondents raised concerns about:\n- Potential discrimination against those with mental health conditions\n- Difficulty in enforcing such restrictions given many mental illnesses go undiagnosed\n- Risk that gun restrictions might discourage people from seeking mental health treatment\n- Possibility of expanding restrictions to other marginalized groups</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Gun Control Perspectives</strong>\nA notable subset of participants expressed views beyond the specific question:\n- Some believe guns should be banned or heavily restricted for everyone\n- Others support general stricter gun control measures regardless of mental health status\n- Several mentioned limiting types of firearms available to all citizens</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Considerations</strong>\nComments highlighted various implementation challenges:\n- Need for clear definitions and criteria\n- Questions about enforcement mechanisms\n- Importance of data from jurisdictions with existing restrictions\n- Balance between public safety and individual rights</p>\n<p>The responses reveal a complex debate with no clear consensus, though there appears to be general support for some form of enhanced screening while acknowledging the difficulties in creating fair and effective policies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
