Many believe that mandatory, in-depth mental health assessments conducted by qualified professionals should be a requirement for all potential gun buyers. The primary motivation for this view is public safety, with participants expressing concern that allowing individuals with certain mental health conditions to own guns increases the risk of harm to both themselves and others.</p>\n<p>However, this support is highly nuanced. A recurring theme is that a blanket ban based on any mental illness diagnosis would be ineffective and discriminatory. Participants frequently argued that \"mental illness\" is too broad a term and that regulations should distinguish between different types and severities of conditions. Many suggested that restrictions should specifically target severe illnesses, particularly those involving a history of violence, hallucinations, or expressed intent to harm. A case-by-case assessment was often favored over a categorical ban.</p>\n<p>Several concerns and counterarguments were also raised. Some participants worried that such a policy would be difficult to enforce, as many individuals with mental health issues are undiagnosed. Others expressed fear that linking gun ownership to mental health status would create a stigma, potentially deterring people from seeking necessary mental health care. A few commentators also raised concerns about a \"slippery slope,\" suggesting that such restrictions could lead to the erosion of gun rights for other groups.</p>\n<p>Finally, a portion of the comments reflected broader views on gun control. Some participants believe that stricter gun laws are needed in general, while others advocate for a complete ban on gun ownership for the general public, regardless of an individual's mental health status.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
