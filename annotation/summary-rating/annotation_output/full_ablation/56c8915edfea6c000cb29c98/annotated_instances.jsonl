Common proposals include universal background checks, mandatory evaluations by qualified professionals before purchase, and requiring clinical clearance for those with a history of severe mental illness or violence.\n- Many see access to firearms by individuals with certain serious mental health conditions as heightening risk to both the person and the public, citing school shootings and self-harm as key concerns.\n- Some caution that focusing restrictions only on diagnosed individuals could be discriminatory and ineffective, noting underdiagnosis and enforcement challenges.\n- The core tension highlighted is balancing public safety and individual rights: commenters broadly support risk-based, professionally informed restrictions, while urging care to avoid unfair targeting and to ensure practical implementation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
