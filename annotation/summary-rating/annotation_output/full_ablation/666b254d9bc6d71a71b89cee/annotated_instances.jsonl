The primary motivation for this view is public safety, with commenters expressing concern that the combination of firearms and mental illness can be a \"deadly mix,\" increasing the risk of harm to both the individual and the community, including events like school shootings.</p>\n<p>Several specific proposals were put forward. A frequently mentioned solution is requiring a mental health evaluation by a qualified professional before a gun purchase. Some believe this should be a universal requirement for all buyers, while others suggest it should be targeted specifically at individuals with a documented history of severe mental illness or violence.</p>\n<p>However, some concerns and counterarguments were also raised. One viewpoint is that banning guns based on a mental health diagnosis is discriminatory. Another practical challenge noted is the difficulty of enforcement, as many individuals with mental health issues are not formally diagnosed, which could make such a rule hard to implement effectively.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
