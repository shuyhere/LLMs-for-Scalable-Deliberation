Many advocate mandatory background checks paired with evaluations by qualified mental health professionals, with some calling for clinician clearance for individuals with a history of severe mental illness. A frequent view is that access to firearms can heighten risks of harm to self and others, and that a history of violence or credible threats should trigger restrictions, potentially time-limited.</p>\n<p>At the same time, several caution against blanket bans for anyone with a mental health diagnosis, arguing this is discriminatory, overbroad, and risks stigmatizing people who are not dangerous (e.g., those with anxiety). Practical concerns include the difficulty of enforcing rules given undiagnosed conditions and worries about a slippery slope of eroding rights for marginalized groups. A minority emphasize broader gun-control measures beyond mental health, while others urge evidence-based policymaking that draws on data from jurisdictions that have tried such restrictions.</p>\n<p>A synthesized path suggested by multiple comments is a risk-focused approach: tighten overall gun safety measures; use behavioral indicators (history of violence, threats, or acute risk) rather than diagnoses alone; and rely on professional evaluations and clear due-process procedures to balance public safety with individual rights.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
