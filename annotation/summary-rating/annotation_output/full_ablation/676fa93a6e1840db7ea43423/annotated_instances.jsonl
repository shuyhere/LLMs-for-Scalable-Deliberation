Additionally, some view blanket restrictions based on mental health diagnoses as discriminatory, arguing that such policies unfairly stigmatize those with mental health conditions.</p>\n<h6>Nuanced Approaches</h6>\n<p>Some comments suggest more targeted approaches, such as focusing restrictions specifically on individuals with documented histories of violence or concerning behaviors, rather than applying broad restrictions based solely on mental health diagnoses. Others propose requiring clearance from mental health professionals for those with histories of severe mental illness, suggesting a case-by-case evaluation approach rather than categorical bans.</p>\n<h6>Public Safety Considerations</h6>\n<p>The tension between public safety concerns and individual rights emerges throughout the comments.

Some suggest requiring clearance from a licensed mental health professional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Emphasis on risk to self and others: Several comments argue that access to firearms increases the likelihood of harm among people with mental illness, including suicide risk, and heightens societal dangers such as school shootings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concerns about discrimination and overreach: Some warn that banning only people diagnosed with mental illness is discriminatory, could stigmatize a broad and diverse group, and might open the door to further rights restrictions for other marginalized groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implementation and practicality issues: Commenters question how such rules would be enforced given undiagnosed conditions, potential privacy concerns, costs, false positives/negatives, and the challenge of defining \u201csevere\u201d mental illness.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calls for case-by-case assessments: Rather than blanket bans, some prefer individualized evaluations that weigh diagnosis, severity, and behavioral history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data-driven policymaking: There are requests to study outcomes in jurisdictions that have implemented bans or stricter measures to guide evidence-based decisions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Areas of convergence\n- Desire to reduce harm and prevent violence and suicide.\n- Support for more robust background checks.\n- Agreement that a history of violence or credible warning signs should trigger greater scrutiny or temporary denial.</p>\n<p>Key tensions\n- Balancing public safety with civil rights and avoiding stigma.\n- Choosing between blanket restrictions, targeted behavior-based measures, or universal controls for all gun buyers.\n- Ensuring enforceability and fairness while maintaining access for responsible individuals, including those with non-severe or well-managed mental health conditions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
