Many suggest that mental health assessments by qualified professionals should be required before purchasing firearms. Several commenters specifically support restrictions for those with \"severe\" or \"extreme\" mental illness, particularly when combined with a history of violence or concerning behaviors.

A recurring theme is the difficulty of enforcement, given that many mental health conditions go undiagnosed. Several commenters worry about discrimination, suggesting that blanket bans based on mental illness diagnosis could be discriminatory and might discourage people from seeking mental health treatment.

They suggest that the type and severity of mental illness should be considered, with distinctions made between conditions like anxiety or ADD versus those involving hallucinations or violent tendencies.
