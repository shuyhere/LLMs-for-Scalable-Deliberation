A significant portion of comments express strong support for mental health evaluations as a prerequisite for gun ownership, arguing that firearms in the hands of individuals with certain mental health conditions, particularly those linked to violence or impaired judgment, pose a serious risk to both the individual and society. Many suggest that any policy should avoid a blanket ban and instead be based on the specific type and severity of the mental illness, assessed on a case-by-case basis by qualified professionals.</p>\n<p>However, a notable contingent raises concerns about the practicality and potential negative consequences of such measures. Some worry that linking gun rights to mental health diagnoses could stigmatize people with mental illness and discourage them from seeking help. Others argue that \"mental illness\" is too broad and poorly defined a category to be used for restricting rights, and that such policies could be exploited to disarm people unjustly. A minority of comments advocate for a fundamental shift in policy, suggesting that the focus should be on broader gun control measures, such as banning certain types of firearms or private gun ownership entirely, rather than singling out individuals based on mental health. Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between the desire to enhance public safety and concerns about fairness, discrimination, and the feasibility of implementing effective and nuanced regulations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
