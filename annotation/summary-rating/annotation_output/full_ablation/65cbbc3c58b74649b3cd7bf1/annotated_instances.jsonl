The primary concern is that allowing people with certain mental health conditions to possess firearms increases the risk of harm to both themselves and others, with many citing the potential for suicide and violence.</p>\n<p>A frequently proposed solution is the implementation of mandatory mental health evaluations or screenings for anyone wishing to purchase a firearm. Many feel that a thorough assessment by a qualified professional should be a standard part of the background check process.</p>\n<p>However, there is a strong call for a nuanced approach rather than a blanket ban. Many participants argue that \"mental illness\" is too broad a term and that restrictions should depend on the specific type and severity of the condition. Several comments specify that a history of violence, combined with a mental illness diagnosis, should be a primary disqualifying factor. This group advocates for assessing individuals on a case-by-case basis, distinguishing between conditions like anxiety and those involving psychosis or violent tendencies.</p>\n<p>Several concerns about this approach were also raised. Some question the feasibility and enforcement of such regulations, noting that many individuals with mental illness are undiagnosed. Others worry that linking gun ownership to mental health status is discriminatory, could stigmatize those with minor conditions, and might discourage people from seeking mental health treatment for fear of losing their rights.</p>\n<p>Finally, a notable portion of the comments moved beyond the scope of mental health to advocate for stricter gun control in general. These participants believe that no one in the general public should have access to firearms, or that certain types of weapons should be banned for everyone, regardless of their mental state.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
