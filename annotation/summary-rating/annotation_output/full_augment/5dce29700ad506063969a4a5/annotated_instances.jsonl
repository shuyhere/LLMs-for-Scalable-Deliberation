Skeptics highlight oversaturation, inauthenticity, and social harms, suggesting the field\u2019s long-term credibility depends on accountability, quality, and media literacy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
