The most frequently cited concern was that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass the increased costs of imported goods on to them. This was seen as increasing inflation, making everyday living more expensive, and disproportionately hurting the middle class and those with lower incomes. Several participants also highlighted the detrimental effect on small businesses that rely on international supply chains.</p>\n<p>Other common arguments against the policy included damage to international relations, the risk of retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and the creation of economic instability. Some felt the policy was ineffective at its stated goal of bringing jobs back to the U.S., believing that companies would rather raise prices than relocate manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of participants viewed the tariff policy in a positive light. The primary argument in favor was the belief that it would have long-term benefits for the U.S. economy, even if it caused short-term difficulties. Supporters argued that the policy levels the playing field with other countries that have historically taken advantage of the U.S. in trade. They believe tariffs will protect domestic industries, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, and ultimately strengthen the economy.</p>\n<p>A few comments presented a mixed or nuanced perspective, acknowledging that while tariffs could protect certain domestic industries, they would also raise costs for consumers and other businesses, leading to a mixed overall impact. One participant suggested the policy might not have much effect at all, as companies find ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
