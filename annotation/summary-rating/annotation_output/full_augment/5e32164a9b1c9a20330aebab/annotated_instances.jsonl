Many highlight the long-term negative consequences, such as reduced innovation, a decline in educational quality, and harm to students and researchers. Concerns are also raised about the potential brain drain, where talented individuals may seek opportunities abroad due to lack of support. A few commenters acknowledge the complexity of the issue, noting the influence of political ideologies in academia and the need for balanced reform. One comment reflects uncertainty about the policy, indicating a need for more information to form a clear opinion. Overall, the sentiment leans toward the belief that education should be prioritized and adequately funded to ensure national progress and individual opportunity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
