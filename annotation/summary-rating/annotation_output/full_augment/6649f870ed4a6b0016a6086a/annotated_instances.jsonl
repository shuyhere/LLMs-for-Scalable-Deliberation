Supporters believe it would increase accountability and reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying and scams. Opponents express strong concerns about privacy, fearing intrusive data collection, potential misuse of personal information by companies or governments, and the loss of anonymity as a form of freedom. Some individuals highlight context-dependent support, suggesting acceptability if mandated by platforms rather than governments. Overall, reservations about privacy and freedom appear more frequently than support, with many emphasizing the value of anonymous expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
