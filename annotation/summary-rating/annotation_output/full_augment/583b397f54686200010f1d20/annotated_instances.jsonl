On one hand, it gives people access to better technology, improved features, and stronger security. On the other hand, it makes devices feel outdated too quickly, creates waste, and pushes people to spend more money even when their current phone still works fine. A slower, more balanced update cycle would be better for both users and the environment."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 20s "}}
