Roughly 70% expect tariffs to harm the U.S. economy, about 20% anticipate benefits (often in the long run), and around 10% see mixed or minimal effects.\n- Common concerns: higher consumer prices and inflation as firms pass costs on; strain on small businesses and the middle class; reduced consumer spending; limited reshoring due to vanished supply chains and investment uncertainty; potential retaliation and deteriorating trade relations (especially with China); risk of slower growth or recession; and broader instability, including possible effects on the dollar.\n- Supportive views emphasize protecting domestic industries and jobs, encouraging \u201cbuy American,\u201d generating tariff revenue, improving trade balances, and accepting short-term pain for prospective long-term gains. A few believe price impacts are minimal so far or that the policy could stabilize the economy over time.\n- Additional notes: Some say companies can work around tariffs, muting their impact; others highlight that outcomes may be highly uneven\u2014benefiting certain industries or market participants while imposing wider costs. Opinions are often tied to views of the administration\u2019s approach, with disagreement over whether the policy is strategic and targeted or capricious and counterproductive.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
