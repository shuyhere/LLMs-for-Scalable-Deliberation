Many believe that companies will simply pass the cost of the tariffs on to customers, raising the cost of everyday goods and hurting households that are already struggling financially. Other arguments against the policy include that it harms international relationships, particularly with China, creates economic instability, and is ultimately ineffective at bringing jobs back to the U.S. because global supply chains are too established. Some view the policy as poorly conceived, benefiting only the wealthy while isolating the U.S. economically.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of comments expressed a positive view of the tariffs. Supporters argue that the policy corrects long-standing trade imbalances where other countries were not paying their fair share. Several comments suggest that while there may be short-term negative effects, the policy will have a positive impact in the long run by stabilizing the economy and encouraging domestic investment. This perspective is often tied to a trust in the administration's business acumen and a belief that the tariffs will ultimately help lift Americans out of poverty.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more mixed assessment, suggesting the policy has both positive and negative consequences or that its overall impact is minimal as companies find ways to circumvent the tariffs.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
