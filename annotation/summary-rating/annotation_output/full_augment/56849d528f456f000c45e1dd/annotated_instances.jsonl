People should have a right to choose whether or not they want the vaccines.

It can also be a health hazard to people as well because you never know how their body will react to the vaccination."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 55s "}}

These individuals emphasize that vaccination and quarantine are essential tools for preventing disease spread and protecting vulnerable populations. Many reference the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of how lack of compliance can prolong public health crises and disrupt daily life.

The primary concerns center on bodily autonomy and individual freedom of choice.

A majority of comments express support for such measures, emphasizing public health, collective safety, and the importance of preventing disease spread. Supporters frequently mention the need for herd immunity, the greater good, and the role of science in guiding these decisions.</p>\n<p>However, a significant portion of comments oppose enforced vaccination, citing concerns over personal freedom, distrust in government or vaccine safety, and the belief that medical choices should remain individual. Some opposition is rooted in negative experiences during recent epidemics, such as concerns over rapid vaccine development or perceived government overreach. Quarantine measures tend to receive broader acceptance even among those who oppose vaccine mandates.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset expresses conditional support, advocating for measures only in truly severe situations, with proven vaccine efficacy, or if vaccines are accessible and free.
