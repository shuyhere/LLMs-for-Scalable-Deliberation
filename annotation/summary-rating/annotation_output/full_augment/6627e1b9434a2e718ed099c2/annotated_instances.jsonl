Many express <strong>positive views</strong>, emphasizing the <strong>opportunities for creativity, entrepreneurship, and accessibility</strong> that this profession offers. Commenters highlight the <strong>democratization of media</strong>, the ability to connect with audiences in authentic ways, and the <strong>economic benefits</strong> for individuals who may not have had such opportunities in traditional industries.
