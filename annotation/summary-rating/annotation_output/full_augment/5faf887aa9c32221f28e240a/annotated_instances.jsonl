Below is a summary of the key themes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Abolishing the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   A significant portion of the comments advocate for the complete elimination of the tipping system. Many argue that tipping is an unfair burden on consumers and that it allows employers to underpay their workers. Some suggest replacing it with a fixed service charge (e.g., 10%) or integrating it into the overall cost of service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improving the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   Several respondents propose reforms rather than elimination. These include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Making tipping optional and only for services that clearly involve direct, personal interaction (e.g., full-service restaurants).</li>\n<li>Ensuring that tipping is based on the quality of service, not just expectation or convenience.</li>\n<li>Encouraging fixed-amount tipping (e.g., $20 or $30) instead of percentage-based tipping to standardize and simplify the process.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customers with a tangible benefit for tipping, such as a thank-you note or a coupon for future use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fair Wages for Service Workers</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the need for service workers to be paid a fair, livable wage, regardless of tips. Many argue that the current system forces employees to rely on customer generosity, which is unpredictable and unfair. There is strong support for raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and eliminating the subminimum wage in the U.S.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Social Norms</strong><br />\n   Some commenters express frustration with the overextension of the tipping culture, noting that it is now expected for almost every service, including takeout, drive-thru, and even self-service transactions. This has led to a sense of pressure or obligation, which many find uncomfortable or exploitative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Form of Appreciation</strong><br />\n   A number of individuals support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be voluntary and based on the quality of the experience. Some even overtip in appreciation for the effort and skill of service workers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technology and Consumer Experience</strong><br />\n   A few comments mention the role of technology in making tipping more intrusive, such as default tipping prompts on point-of-sale systems. Suggestions include making it easier to decline tips and ensuring that tipping is not required until after service is rendered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comparison to Other Countries</strong><br />\n   Some respondents reference how other countries handle service compensation, such as through a service charge or by paying workers a fair wage without relying on tips. These models are often cited as more equitable and less stressful for both workers and consumers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moral and Ethical Concerns</strong><br />\n   There is a sense of moral obligation for both workers and customers. Some feel that not tipping is unethical if the service was good, while others argue that it is unethical to expect tips as a form of income when wages are already low.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, while there is no consensus on a single solution, the majority of the feedback centers on the need for a more fair and transparent system that ensures service workers are adequately compensated and that consumers are not unduly pressured to tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>Based on the comments provided, there is a strong consensus that current tipping practices in the United States are problematic, with widespread dissatisfaction regarding the expectation to tip for minimal or no service, particularly in contexts like counter service or pickup orders. Many express that tipping should be reserved for situations where genuine, personalized service is provided, such as at sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>A prevalent theme is the belief that employers should pay a living wage, reducing workers' reliance on tips and shifting the financial responsibility from the consumer to the business. Numerous comments reference systems in place in Europe or Japan, where service charges are included or tipping is less common, as preferable models.</p>\n<p>There is significant criticism of the pressure and discomfort caused by digital point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip during every transaction. Many suggest these systems should be less intrusive and that a \"no tip\" option should be more accessible.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the act of tipping itself are mixed. A minority view it positively as a reward for exceptional service or a way to supplement income, but a larger portion sees it as an obligatory practice that subsidizes low wages. There is a clear desire for tipping to return to being a voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service, rather than a socially mandatory expectation. The overarching sentiment is a call for systemic change to ensure fair worker compensation and to redefine the role of tipping.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
