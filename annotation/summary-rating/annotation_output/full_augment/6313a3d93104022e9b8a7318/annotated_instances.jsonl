Some emphasize the need for early, decisive action with measures scaled back as knowledge improves.</li>\n<li>Conditional support: About 15% back enforcement only if an outbreak is severe and vaccines are demonstrably safe and effective, with time-limited or situational application.</li>\n<li>Quarantine-only support: Around 10% accept enforced quarantines in serious situations but reject mandatory vaccination, often due to concerns about limited long-term data for new vaccines.</li>\n<li>Opposition to mandates: About 30% oppose giving the government such powers, citing individual rights, bodily autonomy, skepticism about vaccine safety and side effects, conflicting data, and distrust of government competence during COVID-19. Some also doubt the effectiveness of mandates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Common rationales and themes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pro-enforcement: Protect public health, prevent spread, achieve herd immunity, \u201cgreater good,\u201d and lessons learned from COVID-19. A few support strict penalties for noncompliance.</li>\n<li>Reservations/concerns: Personal freedom, informed consent, potential side effects and insufficient longitudinal data for rapidly developed vaccines, fear-based policies, and government overreach or mismanagement.</li>\n<li>Middle ground ideas: Clear evidence thresholds for triggering measures, transparency about risks and effectiveness, robust public education, time-limited mandates with periodic review, and differentiated policies (e.g., quarantine without forced vaccination).</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
