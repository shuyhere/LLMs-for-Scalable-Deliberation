Many feel tipping has become over-expected and uncomfortable.</li>\n<li>Strong support for shifting responsibility to employers: require a livable base wage (at least minimum wage for tipped workers) so income doesn\u2019t depend on tips. Several favor moving toward a European-style model where service is included in prices.</li>\n<li>Many want tipping to be optional and performance-based: tip more for good or exceptional service, less or none for poor service, and only after services are rendered\u2014not beforehand.</li>\n<li>Reform ideas include: replacing tipping with an automatic service charge (often modest) while keeping discretionary tipping optional; integrating service costs into menu prices; standardizing clearer, non-manipulative tipping guidelines; and limiting tip prompts to roles providing clear service.</li>\n<li>Point-of-sale changes suggested: make \u201cno tip\u201d easy to find, avoid high default percentages, and don\u2019t prompt for tipping in situations with minimal service.</li>\n<li>A smaller set supports maintaining or even increasing tipping (e.g., fixed-amount tips instead of percentages, always tipping or overtipping), with one idea to offer acknowledgments or small incentives (thank-you notes, coupons) to recognize tips.</li>\n<li>Additional notes: concerns about affordability for consumers, fairness to workers under the current system, and occasional proposals like making tips tax-free if tipping remains.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
