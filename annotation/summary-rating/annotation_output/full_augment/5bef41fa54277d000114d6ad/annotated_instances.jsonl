The arguments in favor are primarily based on humanitarian and empathetic grounds. Supporters believe it is a moral duty to help innocent people, especially families, who are in life-threatening situations and seeking a better life. Some feel that as a nation with resources, there is an obligation to provide a safe haven, expressing that they would want the same kindness if they were in a similar situation.</p>\n<p>However, this support is often qualified. Several individuals who agree with accepting refugees also stress the importance of a structured process, including thorough vetting of applicants, limits on the number of people accepted to avoid straining domestic resources, and providing education to help new arrivals integrate into society.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there is clear opposition to accepting more refugees, rooted in concerns about domestic priorities. These commenters argue that the country must first address its own problems, such as national debt and caring for its own citizens. They express worries about the economic strain on government expenditure and social systems, believing that resources are being diverted from Americans in need. This viewpoint emphasizes prioritizing the well-being of the nation's current citizens before taking on additional responsibilities.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
