The core of this opposition is rooted in principles of bodily autonomy and individual choice, with many stating that people should have the final say over their own health decisions. Concerns about the safety and rapid development of vaccines, citing potential side effects and insufficient long-term data, were frequently mentioned. A general distrust of the government, stemming from a perceived lack of transparency or poor handling of past crises, also fueled this opposition.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters took a more nuanced stance. Some distinguished between the two measures, supporting mandatory quarantine but rejecting forced vaccinations.
