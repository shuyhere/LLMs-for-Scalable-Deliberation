A significant portion of respondents feel that tipping has become excessive, with requests appearing in situations where they previously weren't expected, such as simple transactions or self-service pickups.</p>\n<p>The most common theme throughout the responses is the belief that employers should pay livable wages rather than relying on customers to supplement worker income through tips. Many participants view the current system as a way for businesses to shift compensation responsibilities onto consumers. Several respondents specifically mentioned that service workers often depend heavily on tips due to inadequate base wages, creating an unfair dynamic for both workers and customers.</p>\n<p>Regarding improvements, suggestions varied but centered on a few key approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete elimination</strong>: Multiple participants favor abolishing the tipping system entirely, with some noting that the United States is unique in its heavy reliance on tipping compared to other countries, particularly Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Living wage implementation</strong>: The most frequently mentioned solution involves requiring businesses to pay employees fair, livable wages, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optional rather than mandatory</strong>: Several respondents emphasized that tipping should be voluntary and based on service quality, not an expected or forced addition to every transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alternative approaches</strong>: Some creative suggestions included implementing fixed tip amounts rather than percentages, adding service charges to bills instead of tips, or creating incentive systems where tips provide mutual benefits (such as thank-you notes or future discounts).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While a minority of participants expressed support for tipping as a way to reward good service or help workers earn more, the overall sentiment leans heavily toward reform. Most respondents agree that when tipping does occur, it should be genuinely optional and merit-based, not a social obligation or substitute for proper wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
