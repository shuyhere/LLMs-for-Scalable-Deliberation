A central and frequently repeated theme is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege. Many feel it is the government's duty and responsibility to ensure the well-being of its population.</p>\n<p>The high cost and inaccessibility of the current healthcare system are major drivers of this support. Commenters describe the existing system as \"wildly expensive\" and \"prohibitive,\" leading to situations where individuals must choose between medical care and other basic necessities, or face debilitating medical debt. Several participants point to other developed nations with universal healthcare as successful models that the U.S. should emulate, expressing frustration that the U.S. is lagging behind. Supporters believe a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes through increased access to preventative care, earlier diagnoses, and reduced financial stress on the population. Some also view it as an economic necessity for a competitive workforce and a matter of national security.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, some offer it with conditions. A portion of these supporters emphasize the need for choice, advocating for a public option to exist alongside private insurance rather than replacing it entirely. Others express concerns about the implementation, stating their support is contingent on the ability to receive care in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A minority of commenters oppose the idea. Their primary arguments center on the belief that the government is inherently inefficient, wasteful, and ill-equipped to run such a program effectively. These participants express concern that a government-run system would be too costly for taxpayers and could lead to a decline in the quality of care, which they believe is better managed by the private sector. Some also hold a philosophical opposition to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
