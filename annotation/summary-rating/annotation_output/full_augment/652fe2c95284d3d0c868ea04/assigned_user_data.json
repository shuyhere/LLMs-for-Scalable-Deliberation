Many argue that the current system allows businesses to underpay employees and shifts the financial responsibility onto customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Forced Tipping:</strong><br />\n   Several commenters are critical of the increasing prevalence of mandatory or suggested tipping, particularly in situations where direct service is minimal or nonexistent (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail). They find it uncomfortable or unfair to be pressured into tipping in these contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Reward for Service:</strong><br />\n   Many commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be optional and based on the quality of service provided. They believe tipping should reflect appreciation, not be a social obligation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suggestions for Reform:</strong><br />\n   Proposals for improving the system include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Eliminating the tipping system entirely and replacing it with a service charge.</li>\n<li>Setting fixed tipping amounts rather than percentages.</li>\n<li>Ensuring a standard tipping structure based on the type of service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adopting models from other countries, such as a flat service fee included in the bill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Discomfort with Tipping Culture:</strong><br />\n   A number of commenters express discomfort with the growing expectation of tipping in many aspects of daily life.
