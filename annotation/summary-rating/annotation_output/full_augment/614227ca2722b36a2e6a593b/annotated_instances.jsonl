It is valued for its capacity to quickly compile and summarize information, helping users learn about new or technical subjects.

While AI is seen as a helpful tool for research, concerns were raised about the accuracy, relevance, and potential bias of the information it provides, highlighting the need for users to fact-check the results. Some view AI as a useful but not fundamentally life-changing tool. Beyond professional and research applications, AI was also noted for its entertainment value and for unique personal uses, such as providing perspective on interpersonal conflicts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
