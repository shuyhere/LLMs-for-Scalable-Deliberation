A significant portion of respondents express concerns about negative consequences, particularly highlighting increased consumer prices, inflationary pressures, and adverse effects on small businesses and low-to-middle-income households. Many believe these tariffs strain international trade relationships and may lead to economic instability or recession.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller but notable percentage of comments suggest potential long-term benefits, such as protecting domestic industries, reducing trade deficits, and generating additional government revenue. Supporters argue that these policies could eventually strengthen the U.S. economy and encourage domestic production, though some acknowledge short-term challenges.</p>\n<p>Several comments also mention mixed or uncertain outcomes, noting that the effects may vary by industry and timeframe, with some respondents emphasizing the need for strategic implementation. Overall, apprehensions about immediate economic strain and consumer burden appear more prevalent than optimism about future gains.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
