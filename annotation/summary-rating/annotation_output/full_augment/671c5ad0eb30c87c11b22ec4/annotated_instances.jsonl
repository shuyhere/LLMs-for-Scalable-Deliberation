A significant portion of the feedback opposes mandatory real-name policies, emphasizing the importance of privacy, freedom of expression, and the risks associated with data collection and surveillance. Concerns include potential misuse of personal information by corporations or governments, the chilling effect on political expression, and the loss of anonymity that enables open and honest discourse.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller share of comments supports the idea, arguing that real-name policies could increase accountability, reduce cyberbullying, and improve the overall behavior of users on social media platforms. Some commenters acknowledge both sides of the issue, recognizing the potential benefits of accountability while also valuing the freedom to remain anonymous when desired.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between privacy and accountability, with many expressing a preference for optional real-name policies rather than mandatory ones.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
