Roughly 50\u201355% oppose requiring real-name registration, about 30\u201335% support it, and the remainder are mixed or conditional.\n- Main reasons for opposition:\n  - Privacy and safety risks: fear of doxxing, stalking, harassment, data breaches, identity theft, and exposure of vulnerable groups (e.g., domestic abuse survivors, marginalized communities). Concerns about employer retaliation and chilled speech.\n  - Distrust and overreach: skepticism about platforms\u2019 and governments\u2019 data practices, surveillance, and data sales.\n  - Practicality: challenges enforcing authenticity, ease of faking identities or creating multiple accounts, and doubts it would meaningfully reduce harm.\n  - Principle: belief that anonymity/pseudonymity is a legitimate right and core to free expression online.\n- Main reasons for support:\n  - Accountability and civility: expectation that tying posts to real identities would reduce harassment, bullying, hate, misinformation, and toxic behavior, and foster a more respectful environment.\n  - Safety and authenticity: reducing bots, scams, catfishing, impersonation; protecting minors; aiding investigations; improving trust in interactions.\n- Common middle-ground ideas:\n  - Optional or tiered verification (e.g., badges/checkmarks) rather than a mandate.\n  - Backend identity verification while allowing public pseudonyms; disclose identity only for policy violations or legal processes.\n  - Let platforms choose policies; avoid government-imposed requirements.\n  - Limit to certain account types (e.g., businesses/public figures) or higher-risk features.\n  - Pair any verification with strong data security, minimal data collection, transparency, and strict use limits.\n  - Use alternative anti-abuse measures (better moderation, reporting tools, CAPTCHAs, phone/device verification) without full real-name rules.\n- Notable nuances: Some argue real-name rules won\u2019t fix behavior or could escalate risks; others see them as increasingly necessary amid AI-driven abuse and rising online toxicity.
