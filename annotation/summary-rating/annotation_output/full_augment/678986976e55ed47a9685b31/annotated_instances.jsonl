A significant portion of commentators emphasize that education is foundational to society and cutting funding risks long-term negative consequences, including reduced research output, loss of talent to other countries, and limited opportunities for both students and adults seeking education. Some express concern about the impact on affordability and educational quality. A minority suggest there might be justifications, such as perceived political biases in academia, but still acknowledge potential downsides to funding reductions. A small percentage indicate they lack sufficient information to form an opinion or express trust that alternative solutions may exist. The prevailing sentiment is that investing in education is crucial for societal progress.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
