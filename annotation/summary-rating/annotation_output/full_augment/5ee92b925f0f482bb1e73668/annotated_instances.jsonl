The primary reason cited is the protection of public health and the prevention of widespread disease for the \"greater good.\" Several participants referenced the recent pandemic, arguing that vaccination was crucial for returning to normal life. One view suggested that enforcement is most important during the early, uncertain stages of a health crisis.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of comments opposed these measures. The reasons for this opposition centered on individual liberty, respect for different beliefs, and concerns about the safety and rapid development of vaccines. One participant also expressed a practical view that enforcement is futile because people will ultimately disregard it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
