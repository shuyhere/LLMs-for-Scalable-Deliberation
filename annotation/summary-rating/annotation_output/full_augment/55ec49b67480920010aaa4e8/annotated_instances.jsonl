A significant portion of respondents favor either eliminating tipping entirely or substantially reforming the system.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns Raised</h6>\n<p><strong>Tipping Culture Expansion</strong>: Many participants feel that tipping requests have expanded beyond traditional service contexts. People report feeling pressured to tip for basic transactions where minimal service is provided, with constant tipping menu pop-ups creating frustration during routine purchases.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Structure Issues</strong>: A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Multiple respondents emphasize that workers should receive livable base wages rather than relying heavily on tips for income. There's strong support for businesses taking responsibility for fair employee compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Voluntary vs. Mandatory</strong>: Participants distinguish between voluntary tipping for quality service and feeling coerced to tip. While some acknowledge tipping as a way to reward good service, most oppose mandatory tipping requirements or social pressure to tip regardless of service quality.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>Several alternatives were suggested:\n- Complete elimination of the tipping system\n- Requiring businesses to pay livable wages to all employees\n- Making tipping truly optional without social pressure\n- Implementing reciprocal benefits for tippers (thank you notes, coupons)\n- Shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping\n- Reserving tips exclusively for exceptional service</p>\n<h6>Diverse Perspectives</h6>\n<p>While the majority favor reform, perspectives vary on implementation. Some participants continue to tip at every establishment out of concern for workers' welfare, while others advocate for higher standard tip amounts. However, the prevailing sentiment supports structural changes to ensure fair wages without relying on customer gratuities.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a desire for a more equitable system that fairly compensates workers while removing the burden and social awkwardness of constant tipping decisions from customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
