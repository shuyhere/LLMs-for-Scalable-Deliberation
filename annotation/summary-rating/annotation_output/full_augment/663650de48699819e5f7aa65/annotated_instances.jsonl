They express confidence in the business acumen behind these decisions and believe the tariffs will help stabilize the economy and potentially lift American workers from poverty. Some note that imports haven't been significantly stifled and see potential budget benefits if the policy becomes normalized.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those opposing the tariff policy cite immediate negative consequences including price increases that are already being felt by consumers. Critics argue that the tariffs are damaging international relationships, particularly with China, while failing to create meaningful job opportunities for U.S. citizens. Small businesses are seen as particularly vulnerable to these policies. There's concern that the tariffs primarily benefit the wealthy while exacerbating inflation and increasing the cost of living for average Americans. Some observe that affected countries are already seeking alternative trade partnerships, potentially isolating the U.S. from global markets.</p>\n<p>The division appears roughly even, with passionate arguments on both sides reflecting fundamental disagreements about whether short-term economic disruption might lead to long-term benefits or whether the policy represents a misguided approach that harms American consumers and businesses.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
