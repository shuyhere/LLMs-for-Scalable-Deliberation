Some link support to U.S. responsibility for harms abroad and argue the nation has the capacity to help.</p>\n<p>However, support is frequently conditional. Common caveats include:\n- Rigorous vetting and background checks, with clear criteria for refugee status\n- Excluding criminals and distinguishing refugees from economic migrants\n- Reasonable limits paced to national capacity, so services and quality of life for citizens are not harmed\n- Ensuring acceptance does not negatively impact the economy\n- Providing integration support: orientation to laws and norms, language and job training, and dispersing resettlement beyond overcrowded cities (including rural placements or temporary camps)</p>\n<p>A significant minority oppose accepting more refugees at this time, citing national debt, strain on social services, inadequate vetting at current volumes, and the view that domestic needs should take priority. Some prefer refugees be sheltered in neighboring countries rather than traveling long distances to the U.S. A smaller group is undecided, empathizing with refugees while worrying about resource competition.</p>\n<p>Additional suggestions and nuances include prioritizing under-supported regions (such as parts of Africa), coordinating international burden-sharing, and adopting a balanced approach that protects refugees without disadvantaging current residents.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
