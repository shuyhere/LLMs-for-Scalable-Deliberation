This support is often rooted in a sense of moral and humanitarian duty, with many expressing empathy and stating that offering a safe haven is the right and compassionate thing to do. Several commenters point to America's identity as a nation of immigrants and a beacon of freedom as a core reason to welcome those in need. Some also argue that the U.S. bears a responsibility to accept refugees, particularly when American foreign policy may have contributed to the instability in other countries.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently conditional. A large number of commenters, including many who are in favor, strongly emphasize the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and prevent individuals with criminal backgrounds from entering. Other common conditions include placing limits on the number of refugees and ensuring that their arrival does not negatively impact the economy or create a strain on resources for current citizens.</p>\n<p>A smaller but distinct group of commenters opposes accepting more refugees. Their primary concerns are domestic, arguing that the U.S. should first address its own internal problems, such as poverty, debt, and caring for its own citizens. These individuals feel that the country's resources are already stretched thin and that adding more people would further strain social systems and the economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
