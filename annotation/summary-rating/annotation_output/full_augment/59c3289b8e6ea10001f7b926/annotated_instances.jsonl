Those who believe the policy has a negative impact cite several key concerns. The most common argument is that tariffs lead to price increases for consumers, inflation, and a higher cost of living. Other participants noted the damage to international trade relationships, particularly with China, and the risk of other countries seeking alternative trade partners. Some feel the policy disproportionately benefits the wealthy and harms small businesses, without creating a significant number of new jobs for American citizens.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the tariff policy see it as a necessary correction to past trade imbalances, arguing that other countries have not been paying adequate fees. They believe the revenue generated will help stabilize the U.S. economy and budget. This group views the policy as a long-term strategy to benefit the country and lift Americans from poverty, with some expressing confidence in the administration's business expertise. One comment directly disputed the claim of price increases, suggesting they have not occurred.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
