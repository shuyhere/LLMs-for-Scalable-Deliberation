A significant majority express support for the idea, often citing moral, humanitarian, and historical reasons. Many emphasize the U.S.'s role as a nation built by immigrants and its responsibility to offer safety to those in danger. Supporters also highlight the importance of compassion, the value of cultural diversity, and the idea that helping refugees aligns with American ideals of freedom and justice.</p>\n<p>Among those in favor, many acknowledge the need for thorough vetting processes, integration support, and careful management to ensure that accepting refugees does not strain domestic resources or compromise national security.

These perspectives often focus on concerns about economic strain, overpopulation, and the impact on existing citizens, particularly in light of domestic challenges such as national debt, unemployment, or inadequate social services.
