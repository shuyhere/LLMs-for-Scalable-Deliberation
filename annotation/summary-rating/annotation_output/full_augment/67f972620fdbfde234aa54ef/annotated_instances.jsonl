Common benefits include faster research and summarization, better writing and editing (emails, resumes, proposals), help with planning and organization (events, tables), idea generation and learning technical topics, creative support (art, photo editing), education/homework help, smart\u2011home assistance, and fixes for dictation errors.

Many emphasized the need to fact-check due to occasional inaccuracy and bias in sources. Privacy and data collection are recurring worries\u2014concerns about tracking, personal information exposure, and lack of control over data.
