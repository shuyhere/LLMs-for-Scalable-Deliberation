Many noted that tariffs function as a tax on consumers, as companies typically pass these costs along rather than absorbing them. Several commenters reported already experiencing higher prices for both imported and domestic goods, with some small business owners specifically mentioning disruptions to their operations. The concern extends beyond just consumer goods, with respondents worried about the broader impact on economic growth, potential recession risks, and effects on middle-class households.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Relations and Global Standing</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple comments highlighted concerns about deteriorating international relationships, particularly with China and other trading partners. Respondents worried that the tariffs are isolating the U.S. from global trade networks, with some noting that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading arrangements.
