A significant portion of commenters also emphasize the need for thorough vetting processes to ensure security and proper integration into society. Concerns are raised about the potential strain on national resources and the economy, with some advocating that assistance for refugees should not come at the expense of existing citizens' quality of life. A minority of comments express opposition, primarily based on the belief that domestic issues should be prioritized first or that refugees should seek asylum in neighboring countries. Overall, the sentiment leans toward compassionate acceptance, contingent on responsible management and vetting.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
