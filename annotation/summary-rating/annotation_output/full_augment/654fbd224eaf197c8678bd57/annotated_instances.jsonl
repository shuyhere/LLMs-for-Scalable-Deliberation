Many worried about the intrusiveness of identity verification and the potential for companies or governments to misuse the collected personal data. The value of online anonymity was a recurring theme, with some arguing it is an important freedom that allows for open discussion and protects users from real-world repercussions, such as losing a job over their political beliefs.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who supported the proposal believed it would foster greater accountability and improve online behavior. They argued that linking real names to accounts could significantly reduce negative activities like cyberbullying and scams.</p>\n<p>A few comments presented a more nuanced view, acknowledging the benefits of accountability while still being wary of losing the freedom of anonymity. One commenter made a distinction, suggesting such a requirement would be acceptable if implemented by the platform itself, but not if mandated by the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
