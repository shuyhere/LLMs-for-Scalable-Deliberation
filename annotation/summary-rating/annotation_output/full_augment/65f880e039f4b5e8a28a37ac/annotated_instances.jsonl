A frequently cited argument is that tariffs will lead to higher prices for goods, as companies will pass the increased costs on to their customers. This is seen as a driver of inflation that hurts everyday Americans, reduces consumer spending, and could harm the overall economy, potentially leading to a recession. Other negative points raised include damaging international relationships, particularly with China, creating economic instability, and the belief that the policy is ineffective at bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller percentage of comments view the tariff policy as a positive and necessary measure. Supporters of the policy argue that it corrects an imbalance where other countries were not paying fair tariffs, and that the revenue generated will help stabilize the U.S. economy. Several comments express a belief in the long-term benefits of the policy, suggesting that while there may be short-term difficulties, it will ultimately protect domestic industries and support American workers. This perspective is sometimes tied to confidence in the administration's business expertise.</p>\n<p>A few participants offered a more mixed assessment, noting that the policy could have both positive and negative consequences, such as protecting certain domestic industries while simultaneously raising costs for consumers and businesses. The idea of short-term pain for long-term gain was also a theme in this group. One commenter suggested the policy might not have much impact at all, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
