Some explicitly favor mandatory participation to enhance sustainability.\n- Comparisons to other countries (notably Canada) are frequent, with calls to match their universal access while improving speed and efficiency.\n- Anticipated benefits include earlier diagnosis and treatment (e.g., autoimmune conditions), stronger population health, improved economic competitiveness, and even national security gains by keeping the workforce healthy.\n- Design preferences include support for a public system with room for choice; at least one commenter wants government coverage available but not the only option. There is emphasis on delivering basic, essential services quickly and efficiently.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
