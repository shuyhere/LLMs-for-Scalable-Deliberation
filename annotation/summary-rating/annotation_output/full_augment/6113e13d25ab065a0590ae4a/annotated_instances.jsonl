Supporters argued that such measures are <strong>crucial for public health, herd immunity, and the protection of vulnerable populations</strong>. Many referenced the <strong>experience of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> as evidence of the necessity of these interventions. They emphasized the <strong>greater good</strong>, noting that some individuals may act irresponsibly without enforcement, putting others at risk. Others highlighted the <strong>scientific basis</strong> for vaccines and the role of government in ensuring widespread compliance for effective disease control.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial number of comments <strong>opposed</strong> government enforcement, often citing <strong>individual rights, bodily autonomy, and concerns about vaccine safety</strong>. Critics argued that <strong>mandatory measures could be abused or based on incomplete or misleading information</strong>. Some expressed <strong>distrust in government handling of public health</strong>, particularly during the pandemic, and raised concerns about <strong>long-term side effects and lack of informed consent</strong>. A few distinguished between <strong>quarantine and vaccination</strong>, supporting the former but not the latter.</p>\n<p>Some respondents expressed <strong>conditional support</strong>, advocating for enforcement <strong>only if vaccines are proven safe and effective</strong>, and if the epidemic is truly severe. Others suggested that <strong>education and voluntary compliance</strong> should take precedence over coercion.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflected a <strong>diverse range of perspectives</strong>, with many emphasizing the <strong>tension between public health and individual freedom</strong>. While a majority supported government intervention during severe epidemics, concerns about <strong>transparency, safety, and overreach</strong> were also prevalent.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
