Many supporters reference the recent COVID-19 pandemic as evidence that mandates are necessary to ensure societal safety and function, with some stating that people cannot always be trusted to make decisions that benefit the collective. However, some of this support is conditional, suggesting that enforcement is only appropriate for truly severe epidemics, with proven and effective vaccines, or during the early stages of a crisis when information is limited.</p>\n<p>Conversely, an equal percentage of commenters oppose government-enforced vaccinations and quarantines, largely on the grounds of individual liberty, bodily autonomy, and personal choice. A primary concern is the safety and efficacy of rapidly developed vaccines, with several people citing negative side effects and the lack of long-term studies as reasons for their distrust. These comments also express a general mistrust in the government, referencing a perceived lack of transparency, conflicting data, and poor management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
