Supporters also highlight the importance of compassion, the value of cultural diversity, and the idea that helping refugees aligns with American ideals of freedom and justice.</p>\n<p>Among those in favor, many acknowledge the need for thorough vetting processes, integration support, and careful management to ensure that accepting refugees does not strain domestic resources or compromise national security.

These perspectives often focus on concerns about economic strain, overpopulation, and the impact on existing citizens, particularly in light of domestic challenges such as national debt, unemployment, or inadequate social services. Some critics argue that the U.S. should focus on resolving its own issues before accepting more refugees, or that the system is being exploited by those who do not genuinely qualify as refugees.</p>\n<p>There is also a group of individuals who express uncertainty or neutrality, acknowledging the plight of refugees but questioning the practicality or fairness of the current system.
