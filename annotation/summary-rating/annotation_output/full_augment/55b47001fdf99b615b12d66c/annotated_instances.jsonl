About 20% oppose, citing domestic priorities and system strain. A small share are undecided or conflicted.\n- Reasons for support: Strong humanitarian and human-rights arguments (safety, dignity, compassion); alignment with American values and history; moral responsibility\u2014especially where U.S. foreign policy is implicated; potential benefits such as cultural diversity, revitalizing less-populated areas, and grateful, contributing new residents.\n- Common conditions and safeguards: Rigorous vetting/background checks; clear limits or caps; prioritizing those facing the gravest risks; excluding criminals and economic migrants; ensuring support does not harm the economy or reduce citizens\u2019 access to resources; education and integration programs; distributing resettlement to rural or less-crowded areas; temporary camps with skills training; in a few cases, prioritizing under-supported regions (e.g., parts of Africa).\n- Reasons for opposition: Concern that resources, services, housing, and budgets are already overburdened; belief that the U.S. should address domestic problems first; worries about insufficient vetting and public safety; perceptions of unfairness toward citizens; views that refugees should seek safety in neighboring countries or work to improve their homelands.\n- Common ground: Even many supporters emphasize balance\u2014helping refugees while protecting citizens\u2019 quality of life. Broad interest in strong vetting, clear criteria for refugee status, and structured integration to minimize negative impacts and maximize mutual benefit.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
