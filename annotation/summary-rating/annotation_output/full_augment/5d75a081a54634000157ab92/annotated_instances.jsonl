Common concerns include fewer opportunities for students (especially lower-income learners), diminished quality of teaching and campus safety, loss of research capacity (notably medical and cancer research), slower innovation, and a potential brain drain as researchers move abroad. Several also warn of long-term economic costs, erosion of trust in institutions, and perceive political or authoritarian motives behind targeting universities.</p>\n<p>A small minority support or sympathize with reductions, citing objections to perceived left-leaning or \u201cindoctrinating\u201d campus cultures, the need to curb wasteful spending, or confidence that the administration has sound reasons and alternatives.
