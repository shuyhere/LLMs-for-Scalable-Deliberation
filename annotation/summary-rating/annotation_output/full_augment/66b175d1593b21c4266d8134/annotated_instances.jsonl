A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the pressure associated with tipping, particularly in situations where it is not clearly justified or expected. Many commenters argue that the system places an unfair burden on customers and often allows employers to pay employees below a living wage, forcing them to rely on tips for survival. </p>\n<p>Several suggestions were made for reform, including the elimination of the tipping system altogether, the integration of service charges into the bill, and the establishment of a livable base wage for service workers. Others proposed structural changes, such as making tipping optional, standardizing tip amounts, or offering incentives or recognition for tipping. There was also support for learning from other countries' approaches, especially those in Europe, where tipping is less emphasized.</p>\n<p>While some view tipping as a voluntary gesture of appreciation, many feel it has become a cultural expectation that is difficult to navigate without feeling coerced. Overall, the sentiment leans toward the idea that the responsibility for fair wages should lie with employers rather than customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
