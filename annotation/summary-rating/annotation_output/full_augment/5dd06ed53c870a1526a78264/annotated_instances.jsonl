Many commenters expressed frustration with the current private, for-profit system, citing prohibitive costs, medical debt, and denied care as critical failures. There is a strong sentiment that a government system would lead to better public health outcomes through an emphasis on preventative care and would be more equitable.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the comparison to other developed nations, where universal healthcare systems are seen as both successful and a standard that the U.S. fails to meet.
