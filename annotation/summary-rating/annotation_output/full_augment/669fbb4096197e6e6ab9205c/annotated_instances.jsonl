Many argue that companies are passing tariff costs directly to consumers rather than absorbing them, leading to higher prices for everyday goods and essential items. Several comments note that these price increases are straining household budgets, with some mentioning that even dual-income households are struggling to stay afloat.</p>\n<p><strong>Skepticism About Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple respondents question the effectiveness of the tariff strategy, suggesting that companies are finding ways to circumvent the policies or are simply waiting them out rather than reshoring operations to the United States. There's widespread concern that the manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains needed to support domestic production have been dismantled and would be difficult to rebuild quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Many comments express worry about deteriorating relationships with trading partners, particularly China. Respondents fear that retaliatory tariffs and damaged trade relationships could isolate the U.S. economically and harm its reputation as a reliable trading partner.
