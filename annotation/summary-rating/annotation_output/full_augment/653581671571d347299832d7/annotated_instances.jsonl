The primary reasons for this opposition centered on the principles of privacy and freedom. Commenters valued the ability to be anonymous online, viewing it as an important freedom that allows for open expression without fear of real-world repercussions, such as losing a job over political beliefs. There were also significant concerns about data security, with fears that companies would collect personal information in databases that could be sold or misused by governments.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a portion of the comments supported the proposal. The main argument in favor was that it would increase accountability for online behavior. Supporters believed that linking real identities to online profiles would lead to a reduction in negative activities like cyberbullying and scams, making social media platforms safer.</p>\n<p>Some comments offered a more nuanced perspective, acknowledging the merits of both sides. One view suggested that such a requirement might be acceptable if implemented by the platform itself, but not if mandated by the government. Another commenter recognized the potential for increased accountability but worried it would come at the cost of the important freedom to speak anonymously.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
