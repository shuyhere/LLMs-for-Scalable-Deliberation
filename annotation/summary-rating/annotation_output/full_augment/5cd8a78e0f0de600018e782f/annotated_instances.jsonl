Many emphasize that education serves as a foundational pillar for society and other professions, and reducing funding could lead to long-term negative consequences, including a decline in research quality and a loss of talent to other countries. Some respondents also express concern about the impact on both students and adults seeking education, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. A minority suggest that there might be justifications for funding reductions, such as perceived ideological biases in academic institutions, but even these voices acknowledge potential risks to independent thinking. A small percentage indicate they lack sufficient information to form an opinion. The prevailing sentiment is that investing in education is crucial for societal progress.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
