A recurring theme is the importance of authenticity and responsibility within the space. However, a minority of voices express skepticism, citing concerns over genuineness and a lack of creativity or uniqueness in influencer content. The comparison to past celebrities is also noted, highlighting both similarities and distinctions in how influencers engage with their audiences.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
