Many believe it promotes <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>, with companies intentionally limiting the lifespan of older devices to encourage frequent upgrades. Some users reported that their devices become incompatible with newer software updates, rendering them less functional over time. Others criticized the <strong>environmental impact</strong>, noting the waste generated by short product lifecycles and the overproduction of devices with only incremental improvements.

A recurring sentiment was that <strong>most updates offer minimal real-world improvements</strong>, making the cost and effort of upgrading feel unjustified.</p>\n<p><strong>Calls for a More Sustainable Approach</strong><br />\nMany commenters suggested a <strong>slower, more thoughtful innovation cycle</strong>, with major updates every two to three years and a focus on improving existing products rather than releasing new models annually. Some advocated for <strong>longer support for older devices</strong>, better repairability, and more transparent communication about the value of updates. There was a strong desire for <strong>environmentally responsible practices</strong>, such as reducing electronic waste and promoting product longevity.</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing and Ethical Concerns</strong><br />\nA significant number of commenters viewed the rapid update cycle as a <strong>marketing strategy</strong> designed to drive sales rather than improve user experience.
