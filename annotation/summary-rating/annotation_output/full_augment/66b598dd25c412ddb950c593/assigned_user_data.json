One commenter trusts the administration may have reasons but stresses the need for alternatives to avoid degrading educational quality.\n- Tone and implications: The tone is often strongly critical, describing the policy as short-sighted and harmful, with fears of broader societal decline if education is defunded.\n- Implicit recommendations: Maintain or increase investment in education and research; if any cuts occur, pair them with clear alternative solutions to prevent harm to access, quality, and innovation.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 10, "num_samples_group_b": 50, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary:\n- Sentiment: Predominantly negative toward cutting academic funding.
