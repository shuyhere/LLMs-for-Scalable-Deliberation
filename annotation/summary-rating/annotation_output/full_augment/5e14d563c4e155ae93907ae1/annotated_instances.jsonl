A common concern was the pressure to tip in situations where it is not warranted or when the service does not meet expectations. Some suggested eliminating the tipping system altogether, especially in industries or contexts where tipping is unnecessary or feels coercive.</p>\n<p>There was a strong emphasis on the need for fair wages for service workers. Several commenters argued that employees should not have to rely on tips to make a living and that businesses should be responsible for providing a livable base wage. This idea was often tied to the belief that tipping should be a gesture of appreciation, not a necessity for workers to earn a fair income.</p>\n<p>A few commenters proposed alternative approaches to tipping, such as shifting from percentage-based tipping to fixed amounts, offering something in return for a tip (e.g., a thank-you note or coupon), or making tipping optional rather than implied or mandatory. Others emphasized that tipping should be based on the quality of service and should not be expected in every transaction.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflected a desire for a more equitable and voluntary tipping system, with a stronger focus on fair wages and customer choice.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
