Many emphasize that the current market-based system fails to deliver adequate care for all, leading to unaffordable costs, limited access, and poor health outcomes. Participants draw comparisons to other countries, noting that many have implemented successful universal healthcare systems without compromising quality or efficiency. A common theme is that healthcare is a fundamental human right and a public good that should be guaranteed by the government to promote the well-being of all citizens. Some also highlight broader implications, such as national security and economic competitiveness, arguing that a healthier population is essential for a strong and productive society. A few commenters expressed conditional support, advocating for government involvement but cautioning against it being the sole option.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
