A majority of comments expressed a negative outlook, while a notable portion held a positive view, often focusing on long-term benefits.</p>\n<p>The most common concern among those with a negative view was the direct financial impact on American consumers. Many argued that tariffs lead to price increases and inflation, as companies pass the extra costs onto their customers. This was seen as particularly harmful to small businesses and everyday Americans. Other negative points included damage to international trade relationships and the belief that the policy fails to create a significant number of U.S. jobs. Some felt the policy was ineffective, either because companies find ways around it or because it will not succeed in bringing industries back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the tariff policy believe it will have a positive impact, especially in the long run. A recurring theme was the idea of short-term challenges leading to long-term economic strength and stability. These comments framed the tariffs as a necessary step to correct unfair trade practices and rebalance the economy. Some view it as a way to prioritize American workers and encourage consumers to buy American-made goods.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more mixed perspective, acknowledging that the policy could have both positive and negative consequences simultaneously. For example, it might protect certain domestic industries while raising costs for others and creating economic uncertainty that could hinder investment.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
