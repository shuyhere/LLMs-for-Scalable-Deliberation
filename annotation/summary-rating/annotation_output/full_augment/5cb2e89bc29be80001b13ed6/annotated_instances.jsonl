Others criticize the minimal, incremental improvements between models, feeling pressured to upgrade despite negligible benefits.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some acknowledge positive aspects, such as enhanced security, better performance, and technological progress. They appreciate access to innovative features and believe updates are necessary for functionality and safety.
