A small minority express conditional support or uncertainty.\n- Common concerns include harm to students and adult learners through reduced access and affordability; diminished resources for classrooms and research; and long-term damage to innovation, economic competitiveness, and public health (e.g., slower medical breakthroughs). Some warn of brain drain as researchers leave for better-funded environments.\n- Several emphasize that education is foundational to society and that investing in it yields broad societal benefits, including safety and quality of schooling.\n- A minority view notes perceived ideological bias in academia as a rationale for reductions, though even these comments often caution against broad cuts or their chilling effect on independent thought.\n- One commenter trusts the administration may have reasons but stresses the need for alternative solutions to avoid declining quality; another seeks more information before forming an opinion.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
