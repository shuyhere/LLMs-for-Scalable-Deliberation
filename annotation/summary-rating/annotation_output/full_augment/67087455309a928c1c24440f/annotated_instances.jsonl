{"id": "triplet_3599_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall, the comments reflect broad dissatisfaction with the current tipping culture\u2014especially in the United States\u2014citing tip prompts for routine or minimal service, social pressure, and the sense that employers are shifting labor costs onto customers. Many feel tipping should reward good service rather than be expected or mandatory, and several would prefer moving toward a system where workers receive a livable base wage so tips are supplementary or unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Key themes and suggested changes:\n- Reduce pressure and scope: Strong support for ending mandatory or implied tipping, removing aggressive tip prompts, and limiting tipping to genuine service rather than counter service or pickup.\n- Pay structure reform: Frequent calls for employers to pay a livable wage, with some favoring European-style models, integrating service into menu prices, or adding a modest service charge while making tipping optional.\n- Standardization and clarity: Ideas include setting clearer, non-manipulative guidelines, switching from percentage-based tips to fixed amounts, or establishing standard tipping tiers by purchase level to protect consumers\u2019 budgets.\n- Incentives and reciprocity: A few propose small tokens in return for tips (e.g., thank-you notes or coupons) to acknowledge appreciation.\n- Divergent views: A minority argues for higher or more consistent tipping (or even compelling it) to support low-wage workers, while another subset would abolish tipping altogether in favor of built-in service charges or fully inclusive pricing.</p>\n<p>Underlying rationales include fairness to workers, transparency in pricing, reducing social coercion, rewarding service quality, and addressing customer affordability.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Partially represented \u2014 main idea but gaps": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Slightly informative \u2014 few basic points": "2"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Very non-neutral \u2014 strongly one-sided": "1"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
