Many criticized ubiquitous tip prompts and \u201cmandatory\u201d expectations, especially for minimal or counter-service interactions.\n- Around 45% favored moving away from tip-dependent pay by raising base wages or baking a service charge into prices, often citing European models and arguing that tipping lets employers underpay staff.\n- About a quarter supported abolishing discretionary tipping altogether and replacing it with included service charges or higher menu prices.\n- Around 20% suggested reforms within the current system, such as clearer standards to prevent manipulation, fixed or standardized tip guidance, or offering small rewards (thank-you notes, coupons) to acknowledge tips.\n- A small minority (around 10%) endorsed larger or more compulsory tips to better support workers.\n- Recurring concerns included fairness (tips for good service, not entitlement), affordability and tip fatigue, transparency in pricing, and ensuring workers receive a livable, predictable income.</p>\n<p>Common ground: strong support for livable wages and reduced social pressure around tipping. Main divergence: whether to abolish tipping in favor of included charges, or to keep tipping but limit it to genuine, service-driven gratuity with clearer norms.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
