Many note that establishments that traditionally didn't request tips now do so through point-of-sale systems, creating uncomfortable situations where customers feel pressured to tip even for minimal or no service. Several participants specifically mention the awkwardness of tablet-based payment systems that default to high tip percentages and make it difficult to decline.</p>\n<h3>Wage and Employment Issues</h3>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Many participants believe the fundamental problem is that service workers aren't paid livable wages, forcing them to depend on tips for survival. This creates an unfair burden on both workers and customers, with the tipping system essentially allowing employers to underpay their staff.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure all workers receive fair, livable wages.
