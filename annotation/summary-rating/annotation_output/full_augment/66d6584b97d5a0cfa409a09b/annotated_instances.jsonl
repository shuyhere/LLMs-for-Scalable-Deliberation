Many emphasized that access to healthcare should not depend on income, employment status, or ability to pay.</p>\n<h6>Key Arguments in Favor</h6>\n<p><strong>Moral and Rights-Based Arguments</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents framed healthcare as a basic human right that government has a duty to provide. Many argued that in a wealthy nation, no one should have to choose between healthcare and basic necessities like food or shelter. Several noted that healthcare access is essential for human dignity and that denying it based on inability to pay is morally wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nRespondents frequently pointed out that the United States is one of the only developed nations without universal healthcare. Many expressed frustration that other countries with fewer resources successfully provide healthcare to their citizens while the U.S. does not. Canada, England, and other developed nations were repeatedly cited as successful models.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>\nMany highlighted the economic advantages of universal healthcare, including:\n- Prevention of medical bankruptcies, which are a leading cause of personal financial ruin\n- More efficient use of healthcare resources when everyone has access to preventive care\n- Better value for tax dollars compared to current spending\n- Increased economic productivity when workers can maintain their health\n- Reduced burden on emergency services when people have regular healthcare access</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>\nRespondents described numerous problems with the existing system:\n- Prohibitively expensive insurance premiums and medical costs\n- People avoiding necessary medical care due to cost concerns\n- Poor health outcomes despite high spending\n- Insurance tied to employment creating coverage gaps\n- Complex bureaucracy and denied claims from private insurers</p>\n<h6>Arguments Against</h6>\n<p>A minority of respondents opposed government-provided healthcare, citing concerns about:\n- Reduced quality of care and longer wait times\n- Government inefficiency in managing healthcare systems\n- Belief that working people shouldn't subsidize those who don't work\n- Preference for individual choice and private market solutions\n- Concerns about increased government control and monitoring</p>\n<h6>Conditional Support</h6>\n<p>Some respondents expressed qualified support, suggesting:\n- A public option alongside private insurance choices\n- Basic coverage for citizens only, not non-citizens\n- Focus on truly essential services\n- Ensuring timely access to care under any new system\n- Coverage limited to those who cannot afford private insurance</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a strong desire for healthcare reform, with most viewing the current system as fundamentally broken and inadequate for meeting citizens' basic health needs.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
