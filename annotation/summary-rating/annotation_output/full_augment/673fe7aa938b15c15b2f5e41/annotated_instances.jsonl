Some supporters emphasize that enforcement should be based on proven vaccine effectiveness and proper public education about the severity of the disease.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commenters oppose mandated vaccinations, primarily due to concerns over personal freedom, belief autonomy, and potential safety issues with rapidly developed vaccines.
