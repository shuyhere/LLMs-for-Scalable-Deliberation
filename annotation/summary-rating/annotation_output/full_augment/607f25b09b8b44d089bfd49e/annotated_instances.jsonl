A significant portion of supporters emphasize the importance of thorough vetting processes to ensure safety and security, and some call for limits or balanced approaches to prevent strain on national resources and existing citizens. Concerns are raised about economic impacts, resource allocation, and the need to address domestic issues first. A smaller proportion outright oppose accepting more refugees, primarily citing economic strains, overcrowding, or the belief that other nations should provide support. Overall, the sentiment leans toward conditional support, emphasizing both compassion and practical considerations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
