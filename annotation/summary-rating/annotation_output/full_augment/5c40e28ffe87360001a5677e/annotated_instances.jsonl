While tariffs were intended to protect domestic industries, they often resulted in higher prices for consumers and retaliation from other countries, which hurt U.S. exporters. Overall, the costs to consumers and exporters outweighed the limited benefits to certain protected industries."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 41s "}}
