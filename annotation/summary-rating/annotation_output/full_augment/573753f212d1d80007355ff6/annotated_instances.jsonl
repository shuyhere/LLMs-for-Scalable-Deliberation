Key arguments in favor included empathy for those in dangerous situations, the belief that every life matters, and the idea that people deserve a chance at a better life, especially when they are innocent victims of conflict. Some supporters felt it was a moral obligation for a country with abundant resources to help others in need.</p>\n<p>However, this support was frequently accompanied by conditions. Several commenters emphasized the need for a thorough vetting process for all refugees. Others mentioned the importance of having limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negatively impacting citizens, as well as the need for programs to help refugees integrate into American society.</p>\n<p>A notable portion of commenters opposed accepting more refugees, primarily due to concerns about the economic and social strain on the United States. These individuals argued that the country should prioritize its own citizens and address internal issues like national debt before taking on more responsibility. They expressed concern that accepting refugees diverts limited resources from Americans and places an increased burden on government expenditures and social systems.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
