Some believe that tariffs will encourage buying American-made goods and help reduce the national deficit over time.

Many are concerned that tariffs act as a hidden tax, raising the cost of living and potentially leading to reduced consumer spending, economic instability, and job market challenges. Some also worry about increased inflation, isolation from global trade, and uncertainty for businesses.</p>\n<p>A few comments note mixed or uncertain outcomes, recognizing that while certain sectors might benefit, broader economic and social costs could outweigh these gains.
