The comments frame this issue as both a moral imperative and a practical necessity.</p>\n<p>A dominant theme is that healthcare should be a fundamental human right, not a luxury contingent on a person's ability to pay. Several people stated that it is the government's responsibility to care for its citizens and ensure that no one dies due to a lack of funds.</p>\n<p>Commentators frequently criticized the current market-based system, describing it as failing to provide affordable, accessible, or effective care. They argued that a government-run system would be more efficient and less expensive, particularly if everyone is required to participate. This was also linked to economic competitiveness, with the view that a healthy workforce is essential for the nation's success and security.</p>\n<p>Many pointed to other countries as successful models for universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. should follow their lead. While the support was widespread, there was some nuance, with one person specifying that a government-provided option should exist but not as the only choice available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
