A strong majority of commenters view healthcare as a fundamental human right, not a luxury or a commodity. They argue that the current market-based system has failed, citing prohibitive costs, lack of access, and poor health outcomes as evidence. Many believe it is a core function and duty of the government to ensure the well-being of its citizens, and that people should not suffer or die simply because they cannot afford care.</p>\n<p>Several recurring themes emerged in support of a government-provided option. Participants frequently compared the U.S. to other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, expressing frustration that the U.S. does not. The economic benefits were also highlighted, with some suggesting that a universal system would be cheaper and more efficient, while also making the American workforce more competitive globally. One commenter framed it as a matter of national security.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, it is not without conditions. A notable portion of supporters emphasized the importance of choice, advocating for a public option that would exist alongside private insurance rather than replacing it entirely. Others expressed concerns about the quality and timeliness of care, stipulating that their support depends on the government's ability to administer care efficiently. Some drew a distinction, supporting government provision of \"basic\" healthcare but not \"extensive\" coverage, fearing potential government overreach.</p>\n<p>A small minority opposed the idea, arguing that the government is inherently inefficient and that the private sector is better equipped to provide high-quality care. This viewpoint holds that \"nothing is free\" and that government intervention would lead to a decline in quality.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
