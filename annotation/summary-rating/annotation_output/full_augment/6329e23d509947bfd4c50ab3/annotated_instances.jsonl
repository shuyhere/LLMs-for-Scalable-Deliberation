A significant portion of respondents express opposition, primarily citing concerns over privacy invasion, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and increased risks such as identity theft, doxxing, or real-world harm\u2014especially for marginalized groups, abuse survivors, or those in restrictive environments. Anonymity is frequently defended as essential for free expression, safety, and protection against retaliation or harassment.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of comments support the idea, emphasizing accountability as a means to reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and harmful behavior. Proponents argue that real identities could foster a more authentic and respectful online environment, deter malicious actors, and help verify users to combat impersonation or bots.</p>\n<p>Some participants express mixed or conditional views, suggesting that real-name registration might be acceptable if limited to verification by platforms (not governments), kept private in databases, or made optional with incentives for verified users. Others highlight practical challenges, such as enforcement difficulties or the risk of data breaches. The discussion underscores a tension between safety and privacy, with no clear consensus but a strong emphasis on balancing these values.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
