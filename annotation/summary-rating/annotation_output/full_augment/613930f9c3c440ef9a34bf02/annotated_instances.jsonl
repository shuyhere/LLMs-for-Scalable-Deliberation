A significant portion of respondents express support, emphasizing public health, collective responsibility, and the need to protect vulnerable populations. They argue that government intervention is necessary to control disease spread, ensure herd immunity, and save lives, particularly when individual choices may pose risks to the broader community.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial percentage oppose enforced vaccination, citing concerns over bodily autonomy, distrust in government or pharmaceutical companies, and potential safety issues with rapidly developed vaccines. Many in this group differentiate between quarantine (which they often support as a containment measure) and vaccination mandates (which they view as coercive). Some also raise concerns about government overreach, constitutional rights, and the potential for abuse of power.</p>\n<p>A smaller segment expresses conditional support, advocating for measures only if vaccines are thoroughly tested, freely available, and implemented transparently, or only during truly severe outbreaks. Across all viewpoints, themes of trust, transparency, and balancing individual rights with collective well-being emerge as critical factors shaping perspectives.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
