Many respondents highlighted increased consumer prices, inflation, and the burden on small businesses and everyday citizens. Some noted that the policy is straining international trade relationships, particularly with China, and is not effectively creating jobs for the general population. A few also criticized the policy as favoring the wealthy or the political agenda of the current administration.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller group of respondents viewed the tariffs more positively, arguing that they help stabilize the U.S. economy by generating revenue and correcting trade imbalances. Some expressed confidence in the long-term benefits of the policy, particularly in terms of reducing national debt and promoting domestic economic growth. A few cited the potential for improved conditions for working families and a shift toward a more self-sufficient economic model.</p>\n<p>Overall, the feedback reflects a divided perspective, with concerns about short-term economic hardship and inequality on one side, and hopes for long-term economic stabilization and fairness on the other.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
