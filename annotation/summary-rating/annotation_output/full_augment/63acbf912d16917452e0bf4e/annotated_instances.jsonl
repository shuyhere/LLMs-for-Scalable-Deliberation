The most common arguments in favor of this position are based on moral and economic principles. Many view healthcare as a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege, asserting that no one should suffer or die due to an inability to pay.</p>\n<p>Economically, supporters point to the current system's prohibitive expense, which leads to medical debt, bankruptcy, and people forgoing necessary preventative care. They argue that a universal system, by including everyone, could be more efficient and affordable. Several commenters compared the United States unfavorably to other developed nations that have universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. is falling behind in caring for its citizens. The belief that it is a core responsibility of the government to ensure the well-being of its population was a frequently expressed sentiment.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some commenters offered conditional approval. A key condition was the preservation of choice, advocating for a public option to exist alongside private insurance rather than a mandatory single-payer system. Others expressed concerns about the potential for long wait times and inefficiency, stating their support is contingent on care being administered in a timely manner. A few specified that coverage should be limited to basic care or restricted to taxpayers and citizens.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a minority of commenters expressed opposition to a government-run system. Their primary arguments centered on the belief that government is inherently inefficient, wasteful, and would provide lower-quality care than the private sector. Concerns were also raised about the high cost to taxpayers and an ideological opposition to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
