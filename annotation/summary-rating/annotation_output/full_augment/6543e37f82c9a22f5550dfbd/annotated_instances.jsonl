The primary benefit cited is the potential to reduce negative behaviors such as cyberbullying and scams, as people would be more cautious if their real names were attached to their posts.</p>\n<p>However, a majority of the comments express opposition to such a requirement, raising several key concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy and Data Security:</strong> A major fear is that companies would create large databases of personal information, which could be misused, sold, or handed over to the government, potentially leading to negative consequences for individuals. The method of enforcement, possibly requiring ID documents, was also seen as intrusive.</li>\n<li><strong>Freedom and Anonymity:</strong> Many participants value the freedom to be anonymous online. They argue that anonymity is an important right that allows people to express themselves freely without being tied to their offline identity.</li>\n<li><strong>Fear of Real-World Repercussions:</strong> There is concern that linking real names to online profiles could lead to negative consequences in the real world, such as losing a job for expressing certain political beliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some views were more nuanced, suggesting that support for such a policy would depend on who is enforcing it\u2014a platform-level requirement might be acceptable, whereas a government mandate would not be.
