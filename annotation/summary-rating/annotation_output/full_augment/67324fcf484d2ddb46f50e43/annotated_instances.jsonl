Many argue that tariffs lead to price increases on everyday goods, rising inflation, and a higher cost of living, as companies pass the additional costs on to their customers. This group believes the policy disproportionately harms middle-class and low-income individuals, as well as small businesses. Other negative arguments include that the policy damages international relations, invites retaliatory tariffs, isolates the U.S. from global trade, and is ultimately ineffective at bringing manufacturing jobs back to the country.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of comments express a positive view, often framing the tariffs as a necessary long-term strategy. Supporters believe the policy corrects unfair trade practices where other countries were taking advantage of the U.S. They argue that it will help stabilize the economy, make American products more competitive, and ultimately benefit the country, even if there are short-term difficulties. Some place their trust in the administration's business expertise to secure a better future for the American economy and its workers.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset of opinions offers a more mixed or nuanced perspective. These comments acknowledge that while the policy may cause initial negative consequences like higher prices, it could lead to positive outcomes in the long run, such as better trade deals. Others see a mixed impact, where some domestic industries may be protected at the expense of the broader economy and consumer welfare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
