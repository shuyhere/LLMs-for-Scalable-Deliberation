A smaller percentage of commenters are opposed to the idea.</p>\n<p>Those in favor frequently appeal to humanitarian and moral principles, expressing empathy and a sense of responsibility to help those in life-threatening situations. Commenters stated that offering refuge is a compassionate act, a way to protect human rights, and a chance for people to rebuild their lives in safety. Some also pointed to the potential benefits for the U.S., such as increased cultural diversity and the opportunity to revitalize rural areas with new populations. One commenter noted that the U.S. has a particular responsibility when its foreign policy contributes to such crises.</p>\n<p>However, many who expressed support also attached important conditions. The most common requirement was the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Other common conditions included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Concerns were raised about the strain on national resources. Supporters with this view believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to ensure that the quality of life for current citizens is not negatively impacted and that there is no competition for essential resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Some conditioned their support on the absence of a negative economic impact on the country.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration:</strong> The need for programs to help refugees integrate into American society was also mentioned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The opposition to accepting more refugees is primarily rooted in concern for domestic issues. These commenters argue that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens, citing national debt and the strain on social systems. They expressed the view that the country cannot afford to take on more responsibility until it has resolved its internal problems and that accepting refugees takes resources away from Americans in need.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
