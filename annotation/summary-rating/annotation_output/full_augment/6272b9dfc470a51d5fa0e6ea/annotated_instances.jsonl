About three-quarters express clear support, around one-sixth support with conditions (e.g., maintaining choice or ensuring timely care), and less than one-tenth oppose.\n- Reasons for support: Healthcare framed as a human right and a core government responsibility; moral concern that no one should die or go into lifelong debt for care; widespread unaffordability and access gaps in the current system; belief that a universal or basic public plan would be cheaper, more efficient through broad risk pooling, and reduce perverse incentives of for\u2011profit insurers; references to successful models in other developed countries; expected benefits for public health, economic productivity, and even national security; desire for equitable access regardless of income, job status, or demographics; emphasis on preventive, diagnostic, and sometimes dental care.\n- Conditions and design preferences among supporters: Offer a public option alongside private plans rather than a sole government plan; ensure timely access and avoid long waits; focus on basic or essential coverage with simple administration; some support universal participation to maximize efficiency, while others stress preserving individual choice.\n- Reasons for opposition or caution: Skepticism about government efficiency and quality; concerns about increased dependency on government and potential overreach or monitoring; preference for private-sector solutions and market discipline; belief that \u201cnothing is free\u201d and worries about costs and trade-offs.\n- Perceived outcomes: Supporters expect improved health outcomes, reduced medical debt and stress, earlier diagnosis (including for chronic and autoimmune conditions), greater fairness, and alignment with international peers. Critics worry about bureaucratic inefficiency and declining quality if government runs extensive healthcare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
