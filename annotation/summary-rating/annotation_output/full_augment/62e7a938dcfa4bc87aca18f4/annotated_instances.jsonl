The most common argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury that should be dependent on a person's income, class, or employment status. Many participants feel it is the government's duty to care for its citizens' well-being and ensure a healthy population.</p>\n<p>Several commenters point to the failures of the current market-based system, citing its prohibitive expense, the burden of medical debt, and the inaccessibility of care for many. They argue that a for-profit model creates an incentive to deny care, whereas a government system could prioritize the public good. Many also draw comparisons to other developed nations that have successfully implemented universal healthcare, questioning why the United States has not done the same.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some commenters add specific conditions. A few believe a public option should exist alongside private insurance to preserve consumer choice. Others express concern that any government-run system must be efficient and provide care in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of participants oppose the idea. Their reasons include a belief that the government is inefficient at managing programs, that the quality of care would be better in the private sector, and a philosophical objection to increasing citizens' dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
