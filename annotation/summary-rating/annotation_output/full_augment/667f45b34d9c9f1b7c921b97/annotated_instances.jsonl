Many feel pressured and \"bullied\" into tipping, especially at establishments where it is not traditionally expected, and they view the proliferation of digital tipping prompts as an overkill that has turned basic transactions into uncomfortable interactions.</p>\n<p>There is a strong consensus that the fundamental issue is low hourly wages for service workers. Many commenters believe the responsibility for providing a livable wage should fall on employers, not customers. The primary suggested improvement is to mandate that businesses pay a decent, livable base wage, thereby reducing workers' heavy reliance on tips for their income.</p>\n<p>When tipping is discussed as remaining in place, most agree it should be reserved for rewarding good service and should never be mandatory or forced. Comments suggest that tipping should feel like a genuine choice to reward quality, not an obligation. A minority of comments propose specific modifications to the existing system, such as shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping or having businesses provide a small token (like a thank-you note or coupon) in return for a tip to make the practice feel more reciprocal.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans heavily toward structural reform that shifts financial responsibility to employers, with tipping becoming a truly voluntary gesture for exceptional service rather than a expected supplement to low wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
