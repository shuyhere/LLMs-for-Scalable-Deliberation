Numerous respondents emphasized that access to healthcare should not depend on income, employment status, or ability to pay, with many expressing frustration that the United States lags behind other developed nations in this regard.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments criticized the current private, for-profit healthcare system for being excessively expensive, inaccessible, and producing poor health outcomes. Many argued that government intervention would make healthcare more affordable and equitable while preventing situations where people must choose between medical care and basic necessities.</p>\n<p>Some supporters qualified their endorsement by expressing concerns about implementation, preferring a system that maintains timely care delivery or preserves some choice through a public option alongside private insurance. A minority opposed government-provided healthcare, expressing skepticism about government efficiency and preferring private sector solutions.</p>\n<p>Several comments framed healthcare as both an economic and national security issue, noting that healthy workers are essential for global competitiveness. The sentiment that government has a responsibility to ensure population health and well-being was widespread among supporters.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
