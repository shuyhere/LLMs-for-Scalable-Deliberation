Some support is conditional on vaccines being well-tested and proven effective.\n- Reasons for opposition: Preference for personal choice and respect for differing beliefs; skepticism about enforceability (\u201cpeople will do what they want\u201d); concerns about rapid vaccine development and potential side effects; preference for encouragement over mandates.\n- Common ground and nuance: Broad agreement on the goal of reducing disease transmission; several comments favor evidence-based, time-limited, and adaptable policies, balancing public health with individual autonomy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
