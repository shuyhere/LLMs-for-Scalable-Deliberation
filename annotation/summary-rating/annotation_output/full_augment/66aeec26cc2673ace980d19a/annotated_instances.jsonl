The technology is constantly being improved and the people who are trying to sell their technology want to get as many sales as possible especially against their competitors so as soon as they come out with a new technology or an update that would give them an edge in the market they're going to put that out immediately to keep their sales up and the more they keep updating the more people are gonna wanna keep upgrading to the newest latest and greatest thing so it's just part of a combination of capitalist business, market demand and innovation."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 38s "}}
