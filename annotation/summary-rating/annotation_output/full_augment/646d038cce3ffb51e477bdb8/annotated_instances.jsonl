Some hope it will help American workers and families who are struggling financially, viewing it as a potential turning point for domestic prosperity.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, critics express significant concerns about immediate negative consequences. Many point to price increases already being felt by consumers and worry about the burden on small businesses. There are concerns about damaged international relationships, particularly with China, and skepticism that the policy will create meaningful job opportunities for Americans. Some view the tariffs as primarily benefiting wealthy individuals while increasing the cost of living for average citizens.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme across perspectives is the tension between potential long-term benefits and immediate economic pressures.
