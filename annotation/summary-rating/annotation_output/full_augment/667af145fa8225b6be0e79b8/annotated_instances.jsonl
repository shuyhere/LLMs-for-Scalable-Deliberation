I know people earn livings this way and I support them fully.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>i have a positive opinion on them, it looks like it opens many doors for them and I also enjoy watching their content and their product's recommendations. some of them have really good content.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I don't personally relate or identify with this specific job/career choice but I understand why it is becoming widespread. It seems fitting given the proliferation of social media in the last decade or so.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>They are doing something they like to do and have the convenience of doing it online at their own convenience. Many are fortunate to make very good income.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I think it makes sense that being an internet influencer is now seen as a real profession, since so many people rely on them for ideas, advice, and entertainment. They play a big role in shaping trends and connecting with audiences in a way traditional jobs don\u2019t. At the same time, I feel it\u2019s important for the space to stay authentic and responsible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I find influencers to be annoying. They do not seem to be genuine and I find it silly that people are foolish enough to be affected by them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Influencers are a great addition to the internet. Not only are they entertaining they have been informative about information that has not broadcast on the news. With this being said I believe this will be the new wave of how we actually get news in the truth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It\u2019s almost like celebrities in the 90s, there\u2019s really no difference except influencers may be more down to earth and expose more of their personal life at first.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>They entertain, pass knowledge and information to the masses, they're the new media houses. While it might seem new to a lot of people, a number of streamers give insightful and cited information. As well as entertain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I think it\u2019s very fun and sort of an easy way to get income all while just living your life. Of course having to keep up with trends after a while people tend to just start following one another. Everyone ends up having/wearing the same thing, no one likes to be creative anymore or unique.</p>\n<hr />\n<h6>Overall Summary</h6>\n<p>Overall, there is a general acknowledgment of internet influencing as a legitimate and widespread profession, though perspectives on its value and impact are mixed.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments express a positive or supportive view. Influencing is seen as a valid career that allows individuals to earn a good income doing something they enjoy with flexibility. For the audience, influencers are valued as sources of entertainment, product recommendations, advice, and information. Some commentators view them as a modern evolution of celebrity or even as \"new media houses\" that can provide insightful, cited information and potentially serve as a future source for news.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there is also clear skepticism and criticism. Some find influencers to be annoying, lacking in genuineness, and silly. Concerns were raised about their societal impact, suggesting they can stifle creativity and promote conformity by encouraging mass trend-following.</p>\n<p>A neutral viewpoint also emerged, where even those who do not personally relate to the profession understand its rise as a logical consequence of social media's growth. Across the different perspectives, there is a recurring acknowledgment of the significant role influencers play in shaping trends, alongside a call for them to maintain authenticity and responsibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
