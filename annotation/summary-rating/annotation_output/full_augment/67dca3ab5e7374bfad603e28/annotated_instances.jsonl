Key arguments in favor included:</p>\n<p><strong>Access and Affordability</strong>: Many emphasized that the current system leaves too many people without healthcare due to prohibitive costs. Supporters noted that people should not die or suffer because they cannot afford treatment, and that basic healthcare should be accessible to all citizens regardless of employment status or income level.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>: Several participants pointed to other countries that successfully provide universal healthcare, questioning why the United States cannot offer similar benefits to its citizens despite being a wealthy nation.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and Social Benefits</strong>: Supporters argued that universal healthcare would create a more efficient system through universal participation, help American workers remain competitive globally, and fulfill what they see as a core government responsibility to ensure citizens' safety and wellbeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Good vs. Private Profit</strong>: Some emphasized that healthcare decisions should not be driven by profit motives, arguing that only government can prioritize public health without the conflicts of interest inherent in for-profit insurance companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualified Support</strong>: A portion of supporters added important caveats, such as ensuring timely care delivery, maintaining private options alongside public coverage, or limiting coverage to basic services rather than comprehensive care.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition Views</strong>: A minority opposed government-provided healthcare, citing concerns about government inefficiency, the principle that nothing should be free, beliefs that the private sector provides better quality, and worries about increased government monitoring and control over individuals.</p>\n<p>Overall, while perspectives varied on the extent and implementation of government healthcare, most participants viewed some form of government-provided basic health insurance as both necessary and beneficial for addressing current healthcare access challenges.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
