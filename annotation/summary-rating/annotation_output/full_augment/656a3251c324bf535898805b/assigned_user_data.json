Supporters argue that real-name policies can help curb cyberbullying, misinformation, harassment, and impersonation.

A few suggest that while real-name verification could be useful for certain purposes\u2014such as reducing fraud or improving authenticity\u2014it should not be mandatory and should allow for the option of pseudonymity.
