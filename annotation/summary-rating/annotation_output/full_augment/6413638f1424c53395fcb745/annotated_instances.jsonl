Many voices highlight the potential negative impact on research, particularly in critical fields such as medicine and science, and express concern about the loss of talent to other countries with better-funded academic systems.</p>\n<p>Some commenters view the cuts as part of a broader political or ideological agenda, either as a reaction to the perceived left-leaning nature of academic institutions or as a deliberate strategy to limit critical thinking and public empowerment.
