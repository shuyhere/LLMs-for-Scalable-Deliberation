Roughly 53% oppose, 27% support, and 20% favor hybrid or conditional approaches.</p>\n<p>Key reasons for opposition:\n- Privacy and safety: Risk of doxxing, stalking, harassment, and real-world harm; particular concern for marginalized users, political expression, domestic abuse survivors, and those wanting separation from employers.\n- Data security and misuse: Fear of data breaches, government surveillance, and platforms selling or exploiting personal information.\n- Chilling effects and fairness: Concerns that mandatory identification suppresses speech and could lead to job or social repercussions.\n- Practicality and efficacy: Doubts it would meaningfully reduce bad behavior; worries about intrusive ID checks and the ease of faking identities.</p>\n<p>Key reasons for support:\n- Accountability and civility: Expectation that tying posts to real identities reduces harassment, cyberbullying, and harmful conduct.\n- Fraud and abuse reduction: Belief it would curb impersonation, bots, scams, catfishing, and possibly identity theft.\n- Trust and credibility: Real names can enhance authenticity and traceability.</p>\n<p>Common middle-ground proposals:\n- Platform-led, not government-mandated: More comfort with platforms verifying users than with state requirements.\n- Pseudonymous front-end with verified back-end: Allow display names while platforms securely hold real identities for serious violations.\n- Optional verification: Offer checkmarks or badges for verified users, particularly public figures and businesses, while keeping anonymous options.\n- Targeted application: Use stricter identity rules for specific contexts or higher-risk features, not blanket requirements.</p>\n<p>Implementation concerns:\n- Enforcement would likely require intrusive ID collection, expanding the attack surface for data breaches.\n- Even with verification, determined bad actors may circumvent systems.\n- Any policy should balance accountability with robust privacy protections and clear limits on data use and sharing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
