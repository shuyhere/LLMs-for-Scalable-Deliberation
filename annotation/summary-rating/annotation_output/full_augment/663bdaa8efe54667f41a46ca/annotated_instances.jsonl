Many note that tipping requests now appear in situations where no actual service is provided, such as picking up takeout orders.</p>\n<h3>Key Concerns About Current System</h3>\n<p>A substantial portion of respondents feel that tipping has become \"out of control\" and \"over-expected\" in the United States.

Many participants point to European models where service charges are incorporated into prices. Specific recommendations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying service workers minimum wage or higher so they don't rely on tips</li>\n<li>Making tipping purely optional for exceptional service</li>\n<li>Implementing a standard service charge (such as 10%) instead of variable tipping</li>\n<li>Redesigning payment systems to make \"no tip\" options more accessible</li>\n<li>Restricting tip requests to situations involving actual service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Perspectives on Tipping Practice</h3>\n<p>While most comments are critical of the system, some participants maintain positive views about tipping when it's voluntary and merit-based.

A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current tipping culture, particularly its overuse and the pressure it places on customers. Many argue that tipping should be reserved for situations where direct service is provided and should never be mandatory or implied. Some commenters express discomfort with the expectation to tip in fast food, takeout, or self-service settings, where they feel the practice is unnecessary or manipulative.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that service workers should be paid a fair, livable wage rather than relying on tips. Over half of the comments suggest that tipping should be eliminated or significantly reformed, with a service charge added to the bill instead. Others propose standardizing tipping amounts or making it more transparent and voluntary.</p>\n<p>While some commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, they emphasize that it should not be tied to poor wages or used as a way for employers to avoid fair compensation.
