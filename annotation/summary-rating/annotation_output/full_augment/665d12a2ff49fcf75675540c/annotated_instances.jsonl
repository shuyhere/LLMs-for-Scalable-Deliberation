Around 10\u201315% offer conditional/qualified support (e.g., prefer a public option or limits to \u201cbasic\u201d benefits), and under 10% oppose it.</p>\n<p>Key reasons for support\n- Moral and civic duty: Healthcare framed as a human right and a core government responsibility for public well-being, fairness, and equal access regardless of income or job status.\n- Cost and efficiency: Belief that universal/basic coverage would lower overall costs through risk pooling and prevention, reduce medical debt and bankruptcies, and improve workforce productivity and national competitiveness.\n- Preventive care and outcomes: Expectation of earlier diagnosis and treatment (including chronic and autoimmune conditions), leading to better health outcomes.\n- System critique: Private insurance seen as too expensive, profit-driven, and prone to denying care; many point to high copays and gaps in essential services.\n- International comparisons: Other developed countries cited as evidence it can work; some suggest leveraging Medicare\u2019s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Common caveats among supporters\n- Maintain choice via a public option alongside private plans; avoid a single mandatory option.\n- Emphasize \u201cbasic\u201d or essential coverage; some want dental and vision included.\n- Ensure timely access and quality; avoid long wait times and excessive bureaucracy.\n- Limit eligibility to citizens/taxpayers for some; concerns about cost control and privacy.\n- Affordability goals (e.g., low premiums) to ensure practical access.</p>\n<p>Reasons for opposition\n- Concerns that government is inefficient, costly, and delivers lower-quality care; fear of higher taxes, crowd-out of other services, and increased dependency on government.\n- Preference for private-sector solutions to preserve quality and innovation.</p>\n<p>Expected impacts if implemented (as perceived by supporters)\n- Improved equity in access and outcomes, reduced financial hardship and medical debt, greater use of preventive care, and more stable reimbursement for providers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
