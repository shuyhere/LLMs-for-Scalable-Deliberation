Some also note privacy worries tied to software updates, and supply-chain factors like tariffs complicating costs.\n- Preferences trend toward a slower, more sustainable cadence: longer release intervals (often 2\u20133 years), extended software/security support, better durability and repairability, and greater standardization (e.g., chargers).
