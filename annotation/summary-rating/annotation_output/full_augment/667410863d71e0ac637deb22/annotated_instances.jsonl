A common theme is the belief that it is the government's duty to ensure the well-being of its citizens and that no one should be denied care or face financial ruin due to an inability to pay. Many pointed to the high cost and lack of access in the current system as primary reasons for change.</p>\n<p>There is a widespread perception that the U.S. is an outlier among developed nations for not offering universal healthcare, with many commenters citing successful systems in other countries as a model to emulate. Some supporters also framed universal healthcare as an economic and national security imperative, arguing that a healthy population is necessary for a productive workforce and global competitiveness.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of comments expressed opposition, primarily centered on concerns about government inefficiency, a desire for reduced government dependency, and a preference for private sector solutions to maintain quality.</p>\n<p>Among supporters, a nuanced view was present in a minority of comments. These individuals expressed conditional support, often advocating for a hybrid system that includes a public option alongside private insurance. Concerns were also raised about the potential for excessive government monitoring and the importance of ensuring that care can be administered in a timely manner without long wait times.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
