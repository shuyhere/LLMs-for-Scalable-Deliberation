The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumer goods, as companies pass the additional costs onto customers. Many note that prices have already risen since implementation, affecting everything from everyday essentials to business supplies. Several commenters worry this will reduce consumer spending power and potentially trigger a recession.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects on Business and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Small businesses appear particularly vulnerable, with multiple business owners reporting direct negative impacts on their operations.
