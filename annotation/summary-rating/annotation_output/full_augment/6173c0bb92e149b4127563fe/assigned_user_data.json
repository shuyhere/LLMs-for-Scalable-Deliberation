Many highlighted that tariffs lead to increased prices for consumers, as businesses pass on the additional costs.

Several commenters expressed confidence in the business-minded approach behind the policy, suggesting that short-term challenges may lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation and Effectiveness Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple commenters questioned the effectiveness of the tariff implementation. Some noted that companies are finding ways to circumvent the policies, while others pointed out that reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. is challenging due to the loss of factories and supply chains.
