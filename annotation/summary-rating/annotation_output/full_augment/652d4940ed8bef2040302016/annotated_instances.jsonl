Several comments referenced the recent COVID-19 pandemic as evidence that a lack of vaccination and quarantine adherence can slow down the return to normal life. Some who agreed with enforcement did so with conditions, stating it should only be applied when an epidemic is truly severe, when a vaccine is proven effective, or early on when a virus is not well understood.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a significant portion of comments opposed mandatory vaccinations, emphasizing individual liberty and bodily autonomy. These respondents raised strong concerns about vaccine safety, particularly for vaccines developed rapidly, citing potential side effects and the lack of long-term data. Mistrust in the government's handling of past health crises and the belief that conflicting data can create public fear were also mentioned as reasons for opposition. Some made a distinction, stating that while they oppose forced vaccination, they would support quarantine measures in a severe situation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
