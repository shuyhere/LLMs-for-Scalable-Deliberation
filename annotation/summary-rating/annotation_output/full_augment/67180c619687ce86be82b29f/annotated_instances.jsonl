Many believe it is a compassionate duty to help those in life-threatening situations, with some stating that offering refuge is a core American value or a responsibility given the country's role in global affairs.

The idea of balancing compassion with practicality was central to these views.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters voiced opposition to accepting more refugees. The primary reason for this stance was the belief that the United States should prioritize its own domestic problems, such as national debt and caring for its citizens, before taking on additional responsibilities. These participants argued that current resources are already strained and that accepting more refugees would worsen the situation for Americans.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
