A recurring theme is the feeling of being pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping, particularly with digital payment systems that make it uncomfortable to decline. Many note that tipping requests now appear in situations where no actual service is provided, such as picking up takeout orders.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns About Current System</h6>\n<p>A substantial portion of respondents feel that tipping has become \"out of control\" and \"over-expected\" in the United States. They express frustration with:\n- Point-of-sale systems that default to high tip percentages\n- Being asked to tip before receiving service\n- The expansion of tipping to non-service transactions\n- The awkwardness of declining to tip in face-to-face interactions</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure workers receive livable base wages. Many participants point to European models where service charges are incorporated into prices. Specific recommendations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paying service workers minimum wage or higher so they don't rely on tips</li>\n<li>Making tipping purely optional for exceptional service</li>\n<li>Implementing a standard service charge (such as 10%) instead of variable tipping</li>\n<li>Redesigning payment systems to make \"no tip\" options more accessible</li>\n<li>Restricting tip requests to situations involving actual service</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Perspectives on Tipping Practice</h6>\n<p>While most comments are critical of the system, some participants maintain positive views about tipping when it's voluntary and merit-based. These individuals:\n- Always tip at restaurants and for delivery services\n- Believe in rewarding good service\n- Recognize that workers currently depend on tips due to low base wages\n- View tipping as a way to show appreciation for hard work</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments suggest strong support for reforming the tipping system, with most favoring either its elimination or significant restructuring to reduce pressure on consumers while ensuring fair compensation for workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
