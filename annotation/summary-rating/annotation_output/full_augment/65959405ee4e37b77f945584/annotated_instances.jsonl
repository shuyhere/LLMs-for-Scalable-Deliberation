The primary arguments for this position are that it would reduce harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of inflammatory speech. Supporters feel that attaching a real identity to online activity would make people act more responsibly. It is also seen as a way to combat identity theft, catfishing, and the use of bots or imposter accounts.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a majority of comments expressed strong opposition, citing fundamental concerns about privacy, safety, and freedom. Opponents argue that mandatory real-name registration is an invasion of privacy and that individuals have a right to be anonymous online. A major fear is how tech companies and governments would use this data, with concerns about it being sold, leaked in data breaches, or used for surveillance. Furthermore, opponents believe anonymity is crucial for protecting vulnerable individuals, such as domestic abuse survivors or those who could face real-world consequences\u2014like job loss or stalking\u2014for expressing personal or political views. Some also questioned the effectiveness of such a policy, suggesting it might not change behavior or could even worsen cyberbullying by revealing real identities.</p>\n<p>Several comments offered a more nuanced perspective or proposed alternative solutions. These individuals acknowledged the benefits of accountability but were wary of the risks. A common middle-ground suggestion was a hybrid system: requiring real identity for back-end verification that remains private from the public, while still allowing users to post under a pseudonym. This would allow platforms to take action against malicious users without compromising everyone's public anonymity. Other suggestions included making real-name use optional or creating a voluntary verification system (e.g., a checkmark) for those who wish to confirm their identity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
