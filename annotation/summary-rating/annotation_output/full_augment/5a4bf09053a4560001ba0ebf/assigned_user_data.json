Some see the updates as essential for staying current with evolving technology and maintaining device functionality.

Many believe it promotes <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>, with companies intentionally limiting the lifespan of older devices to encourage frequent upgrades. Some users reported that their devices become incompatible with newer software updates, rendering them less functional over time. Others criticized the <strong>environmental impact</strong>, noting the waste generated by short product lifecycles and the overproduction of devices with only incremental improvements.
