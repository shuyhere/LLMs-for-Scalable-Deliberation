Many believe it is a compassionate duty to help those in life-threatening situations, with some stating that offering refuge is a core American value or a responsibility given the country's role in global affairs. The idea that all people deserve safety and a chance at a better life was a common theme among supporters.</p>\n<p>However, this support is often conditional. The most frequently mentioned condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Another significant concern is the potential strain on national resources. Many commenters believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negative economic impacts and ensure that the needs of current citizens are met. The idea of balancing compassion with practicality was central to these views.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters voiced opposition to accepting more refugees. The primary reason for this stance was the belief that the United States should prioritize its own domestic problems, such as national debt and caring for its citizens, before taking on additional responsibilities. These participants argued that current resources are already strained and that accepting more refugees would worsen the situation for Americans.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
