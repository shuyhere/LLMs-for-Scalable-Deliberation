Many reported that AI helps them complete routine tasks faster, freeing up time for more meaningful activities. Participants specifically mentioned benefits like streamlining work processes, speeding up research, and handling time-consuming tasks that previously required manual effort. Several noted that AI serves as a valuable assistant for professional tasks such as writing emails, creating resumes, and perfecting proposals.</p>\n<h3>Information Access and Learning</h3>\n<p>Many participants emphasized AI's role in transforming how they access and process information. Several compared AI tools like ChatGPT to an improved version of traditional search engines, providing quick summaries and relevant sources. Respondents appreciated the ability to learn about complex technical subjects more easily and obtain answers within seconds. Some mentioned that AI has made research more convenient, though they acknowledged the need to fact-check results and verify sources.</p>\n<h3>Creative and Personal Applications</h3>\n<p>AI's impact on creative endeavors received mixed responses. Some participants celebrated AI's ability to help with artistic expression, image editing, and generating new ideas for projects like home remodeling.
