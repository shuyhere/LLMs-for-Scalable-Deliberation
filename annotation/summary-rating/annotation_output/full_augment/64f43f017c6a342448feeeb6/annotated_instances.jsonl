Several participants noted the detrimental effect on international relations, stating that the policy hurts the U.S.'s relationship with trading partners, could lead to retaliatory tariffs, and isolates the country from global trade.

Reasons for this positive outlook included the belief that tariffs correct unfair trade practices where other countries have taken advantage of the U.S., encourage the purchase of American-made goods, and ultimately help the national budget and lift Americans out of poverty.
