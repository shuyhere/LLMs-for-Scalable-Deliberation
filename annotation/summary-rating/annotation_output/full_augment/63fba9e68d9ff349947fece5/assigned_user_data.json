Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. This comparison reinforces the view that the American tipping system is unique and potentially problematic.</p>\n<p>The consensus suggests strong dissatisfaction with how tipping culture has evolved, with most preferring either its elimination in favor of fair wages or its return to being a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to inadequate pay.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "type": "comparison", "model": "comparison", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 10, "num_samples_group_b": 50, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": "gpt-5", "model_b": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "summary_a_id": "3182752cbdecf724", "summary_b_id": "640fd31169102e55", "summary_a_text": "Overall summary:\n- Broad frustration with \u201ctipflation\u201d and pressure: Many feel tipping prompts are overused, especially for minimal or no service, and oppose mandatory or implied tipping.\n- Principle for tipping: Strong preference that tips be optional and tied to the quality of service, not an expectation on every transaction.\n- Wages and responsibility: Frequent calls for employers to pay a livable base wage so workers don\u2019t have to rely on tips; tips should be a bonus, not a substitute for fair pay.\n- Divergent ideas: A small share want to eliminate tipping entirely, while a smaller group favors higher, fixed-dollar tips (e.g., standard $20\u2013$30) instead of percentages to better reflect effort on low bills.\n- Incentives and recognition: Some suggest giving something tangible for tips\u2014such as thank-you notes or coupons\u2014to acknowledge generosity.\n- Flexibility and equity: Acknowledgment that people\u2019s finances vary; tipping should allow discretion without guilt or coercion.\n\nCommon suggestions:\n- End mandatory tipping and reduce aggressive or default tip prompts, especially for low- or no-service interactions.\n- Require employers to provide a livable base wage.\n- Keep tipping as a voluntary reward for good service.\n- Consider fixed-dollar tip options and simple, transparent prompts.\n- Offer appreciative gestures (notes/coupons) to recognize tips without making them obligatory.", "summary_b_text": "Based on the comments provided, here is an overall summary of opinions on the tipping system:\n\n**Opposition to Current Tipping Culture**\nThe overwhelming majority of respondents express frustration with the current tipping system.
