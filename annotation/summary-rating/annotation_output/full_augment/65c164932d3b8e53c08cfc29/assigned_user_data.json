Common complaints include being asked to tip for minimal service (such as picking up takeout orders or purchasing pre-made items), feeling pressured by point-of-sale systems, and the expansion of tipping requests beyond traditional service industries.</p>\n<h3>Support for Fair Wages</h3>\n<p>A dominant theme throughout the comments is the belief that workers should receive livable wages from their employers rather than relying on tips for income. Many respondents view the current system as a way for businesses to avoid paying fair wages, shifting the burden to consumers. The particularly low base wage for tipped workers (especially the $2.13/hour for servers) is frequently cited as problematic.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on When Tipping is Appropriate</h3>\n<p>While views vary, many respondents distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus excessive.
