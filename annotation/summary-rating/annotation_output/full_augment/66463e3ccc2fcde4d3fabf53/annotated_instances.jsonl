The most common reason cited was the belief that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass on the increased costs. This was seen as a burden on everyday Americans, potentially increasing inflation and harming small businesses. Other negative arguments included that the policy damages international relationships, particularly with China, and tarnishes the U.S.'s reputation as a trading partner without creating a significant number of American jobs. Some viewed the policy as misguided and beneficial only to the wealthy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of comments described the policy's impact as positive. Supporters often framed the tariffs as a necessary long-term strategy, even if they cause short-term difficulties. The core arguments for this view were that the policy corrects unfair trade imbalances, generates needed revenue for the U.S., and will ultimately encourage consumers to buy American-made goods. Some expressed confidence in the president's business expertise, while others saw it as a way to prioritize and lift American workers out of poverty.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of participants held a more mixed or neutral view. They suggested the policy has both positive and negative effects, such as protecting certain domestic industries while simultaneously raising costs for businesses and creating economic uncertainty. One commenter felt the policy was having little to no impact, as companies were finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
