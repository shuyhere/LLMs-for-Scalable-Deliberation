A significant portion of the feedback emphasizes the foundational role of education in societal and economic development, warning that reduced funding could hinder innovation, weaken future competitiveness, and limit opportunities for students and researchers. Many voices highlight the potential negative impact on research, particularly in critical fields such as medicine and science, and express concern about the loss of talent to other countries with better-funded academic systems.</p>\n<p>Some commenters view the cuts as part of a broader political or ideological agenda, either as a reaction to the perceived left-leaning nature of academic institutions or as a deliberate strategy to limit critical thinking and public empowerment. Others criticize the decision as short-sighted and harmful to national progress, especially for vulnerable populations and future generations.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of responses offer more neutral or positive perspectives, with some acknowledging the need for fiscal responsibility or expressing confidence in the decision based on ideological alignment.
