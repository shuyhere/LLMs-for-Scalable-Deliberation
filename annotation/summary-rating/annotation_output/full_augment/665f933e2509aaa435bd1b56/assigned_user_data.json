The freedom to be anonymous is seen as a critical component of free speech, allowing individuals to express dissenting or unpopular opinions without fear of real-world consequences, such as professional repercussions. Furthermore, several commenters highlighted that anonymity serves as a crucial safety measure for vulnerable individuals, including victims of domestic abuse or members of marginalized communities, who could be put at risk if their identities were public.
