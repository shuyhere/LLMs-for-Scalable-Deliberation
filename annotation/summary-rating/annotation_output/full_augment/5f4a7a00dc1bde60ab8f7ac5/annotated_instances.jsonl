They argue that access to medical care should not depend on income, employment status, or social class. Several emphasize that in a wealthy nation, ensuring citizens' health is a core governmental responsibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Concerns</strong>\nA significant portion of comments highlight the current system's financial burdens. Respondents describe healthcare as \"wildly expensive\" and \"insanely expensive,\" with some preferring death over medical debt. They argue that universal healthcare would be more cost-effective overall and eliminate the impossible choices between basic needs like food, rent, and medical care.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nMultiple participants point to other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, expressing frustration that the United States lags behind. They question why other countries can offer this service while America, despite its wealth and self-proclaimed greatness, cannot.</p>\n<p><strong>Systemic Failures of Current System</strong>\nRespondents criticize the profit-driven nature of private healthcare, arguing that for-profit corporations have incentives to deny care. They note poor health outcomes despite high costs, limited access to care, and inadequate coverage even for veterans.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Competitiveness and National Security</strong>\nSome frame universal healthcare as essential for American workers to compete globally and even as a national security issue, arguing that a healthy population is crucial for the nation's strength.</p>\n<h3>Moderate Positions</h3>\n<p>A small percentage advocate for a mixed approach, supporting government-provided basic care alongside private options, emphasizing the importance of choice.
