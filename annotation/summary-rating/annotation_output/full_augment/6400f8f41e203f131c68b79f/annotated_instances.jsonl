The most common reasons for this support include empathy for those in life-threatening situations, the belief that everyone deserves safety and a chance at a better life, and the idea that it is the right and compassionate thing to do. Some view it as a core American value to welcome those fleeing persecution, while others feel the U.S. has a particular obligation to help, especially when its foreign policy may have contributed to the instability in other regions.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently accompanied by important conditions and concerns. The most prevalent condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out individuals with criminal backgrounds. Many also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid straining national resources and negatively impacting the quality of life for current citizens. A balanced approach is often called for, ensuring that the needs of both refugees and citizens are met without creating competition for resources.</p>\n<p>A smaller group of comments expresses opposition to accepting more refugees. The primary arguments against it center on the belief that the country has too many domestic problems and should prioritize its own citizens first. These comments highlight concerns about economic strain, the national debt, and the burden on social systems. Some feel that resources are being diverted from Americans in need to refugees and that refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
