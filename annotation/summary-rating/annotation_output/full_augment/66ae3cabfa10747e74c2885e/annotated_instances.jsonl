However, some acknowledge the potential benefits while also recognizing the value of anonymity in preserving certain freedoms of speech and self-expression.</p>\n<p>A few respondents expressed conditional support, depending on who enforces the policy\u2014suggesting greater trust in platforms over governments in this regard.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between accountability and privacy, with no clear consensus but a strong emphasis on the need to protect individual rights and freedoms online.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
