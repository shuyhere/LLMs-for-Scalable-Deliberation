A significant percentage of respondents believe these cuts will harm students, limit educational opportunities, and disproportionately affect those who cannot afford education. Many also express concern that reducing funding will cripple research and innovation, particularly in critical fields like medicine, thereby weakening the nation's global competitiveness and causing a \"brain drain\" as researchers seek opportunities overseas.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments acknowledge the possibility of wasteful spending in academia or express trust that the administration may have justifications for the cuts, though these are far outnumbered by critical views.
