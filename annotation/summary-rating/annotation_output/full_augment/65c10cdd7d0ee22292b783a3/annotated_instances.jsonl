Many feel the responsibility for fair compensation should fall on the business, not the customer.</p>\n<p>There is a strong sentiment against the growing pressure and obligation to tip. Commenters expressed frustration with being prompted to tip for every small transaction and feeling bullied or forced into it. The consensus is that tipping should be a voluntary act, not a mandatory or expected fee.</p>\n<p>Ideally, tipping is seen as a reward for excellent service. It is viewed as an extra gesture to show appreciation, rather than an automatic charge for minimal or non-existent service.</p>\n<p>While some suggest eliminating the tipping system altogether, others proposed creative changes. These ideas include shifting from a percentage-based system to a standard fixed-dollar amount or implementing a reciprocal system where the customer receives something like a thank-you note or a future coupon in exchange for a tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
