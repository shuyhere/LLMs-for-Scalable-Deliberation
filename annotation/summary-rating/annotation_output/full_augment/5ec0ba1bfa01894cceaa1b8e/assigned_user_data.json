Concerns include rising consumer prices, increased inflation, and the burden on everyday Americans, particularly those in lower-income brackets. Many argue that the costs of tariffs are passed down to consumers rather than being absorbed by corporations. There is also concern about strained international trade relationships, reduced global competitiveness, and the potential for retaliatory tariffs from other countries. Some commenters highlight the negative effects on small businesses and the long-term uncertainty for economic stability. Others criticize the administration's approach as poorly thought-out or self-serving, pointing out that reshoring industries may not be feasible due to existing global supply chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Impact (Approximately 15% of comments):</strong><br />\nA smaller number of commenters believe the tariff policy will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy. These perspectives often emphasize long-term economic growth, increased tax revenue, and the potential for a more self-sufficient economy. Some argue that the tariffs will help reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, and correct unfair trade practices by other countries. A few mention that while there may be short-term challenges, the policy could lead to better trade agreements and a stronger domestic manufacturing sector in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed or Neutral (Approximately 15% of comments):</strong><br />\nSome commenters acknowledge both positive and negative aspects of the policy.
