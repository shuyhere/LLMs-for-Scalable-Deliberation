When foreign companies and businesses realize they can't get money from Americans due to the tariffs that increase the prices of their products that have increased previously thanks to inflation and now the tarrifs they will end up loosing customers and the customers themselves will be emotionally drained and depressed knowing they can't get the products they want. Furthermore in turn America will lose business with foreign countries because of things the foreign countries bought from us as American products will be increased thanks to the tariffs as well. The foreign countries will be deterred from doing business with Americans based on their lack of drive to buy from them and thus society in the US as well as its economy will become worse."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 4m 37s "}}

Concerns were also raised about the policy harming small businesses, damaging international trade relationships, and failing to create a significant number of new jobs. Some feel the tariffs primarily benefit the wealthy rather than the general population.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the policy see it as a positive and necessary step. They argue that it levels the playing field with other countries that were previously paying little to no tariffs, bringing in revenue that helps stabilize the economy and benefit the national budget.
