About 57% support government authority to enforce vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics, with a portion emphasizing conditions such as proven safety and effectiveness of vaccines, clear severity thresholds, strong public communication, and time-limited measures. Roughly 37% oppose such mandates, citing bodily autonomy, civil liberties, distrust in government, perceived poor handling of COVID-19, and concerns about vaccine safety or insufficient long-term data. Around 7% support enforcing quarantine but oppose mandatory vaccination, often due to concerns about medical choice and limited longitudinal evidence for newly developed vaccines.</p>\n<p>Key themes:\n- Pro-enforcement rationales: protecting public health and the \u201cgreater good,\u201d preventing mass spread and deaths, achieving herd immunity, and the government\u2019s duty to act decisively in crises; some favor penalties for noncompliance.\n- Conditional support: mandates only if an epidemic is truly severe, vaccines are demonstrably safe and effective, measures are transparent, well-communicated, and rolled back as evidence improves.\n- Anti-enforcement rationales: individual rights and bodily autonomy, skepticism about government competence and transparency, doubts about vaccine safety and long-term effects, and concerns that mandates are counterproductive or fear-inducing.\n- Differentiation between tools: a subset accepts quarantine in severe scenarios but rejects compulsory vaccination.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
