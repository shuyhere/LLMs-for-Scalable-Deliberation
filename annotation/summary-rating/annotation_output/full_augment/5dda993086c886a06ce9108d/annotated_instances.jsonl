Many argue that it promotes planned obsolescence, where companies intentionally design products with limited longevity to encourage frequent replacements.

Some commenters feel that the changes between models are minimal and do not justify the cost or the environmental impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Consumerism and Waste:</strong>\nThere is a strong concern that the cycle encourages unnecessary consumption and a culture of disposability.
