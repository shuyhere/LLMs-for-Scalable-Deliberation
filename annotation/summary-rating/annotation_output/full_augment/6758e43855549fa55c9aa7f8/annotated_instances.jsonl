A majority of the comments express support for accepting refugees, often grounded in humanitarian principles, moral responsibility, and the idea of providing safety and opportunity to those in need. Many emphasize the importance of compassion, the value of cultural diversity, and the historical role of the United States as a refuge for those fleeing persecution.</p>\n<p>However, several comments also express reservations or conditions for support. These include concerns about the economic impact on citizens, the need for thorough vetting processes, and the importance of balancing refugee needs with the needs of current residents. Some argue that the government should not accept more refugees until it addresses domestic issues and ensures sufficient resources for its own citizens.</p>\n<p>There is also a recurring theme of the need for limits, integration support, and careful management of refugee programs to prevent overburdening social systems and infrastructure. While most support is expressed unconditionally, a significant portion comes with caveats, particularly regarding vetting procedures and the exclusion of economic migrants or individuals with criminal backgrounds.</p>\n<p>In summary, the sentiment is largely in favor of accepting refugees fleeing persecution, but with a strong emphasis on responsible and balanced policies that protect both the well-being of refugees and the interests of current citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
