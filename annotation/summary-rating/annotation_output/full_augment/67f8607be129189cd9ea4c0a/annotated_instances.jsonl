Many argue that tipping should be voluntary and based on the quality of service, rather than being an automatic expectation. Some commenters criticize the way tipping is implemented in point-of-sale systems, noting that it can feel coercive or uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<p>Several commenters suggest that the root issue lies in low wages for service workers and advocate for a system in which employees are paid a livable wage by their employers, making tipping unnecessary or optional. Others propose alternative models, such as a fixed service charge or a more structured tipping system that ensures fair compensation without pressuring customers.</p>\n<p>There is also a general consensus that tipping should be a gesture of appreciation rather than an obligation. A few commenters support the idea of tipping as a way to reward exceptional service, while others suggest tangible rewards or recognition for tippers as a way to make the practice more meaningful.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights a desire for a more equitable and voluntary tipping system, with a strong emphasis on fair wages for workers and a shift away from the current culture of expectation and pressure.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
