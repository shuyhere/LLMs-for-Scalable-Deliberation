Several people stated that it is the government's responsibility to care for its citizens and ensure that no one dies due to a lack of funds.</p>\n<p>Commentators frequently criticized the current market-based system, describing it as failing to provide affordable, accessible, or effective care. They argued that a government-run system would be more efficient and less expensive, particularly if everyone is required to participate. This was also linked to economic competitiveness, with the view that a healthy workforce is essential for the nation's success and security.</p>\n<p>Many pointed to other countries as successful models for universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. should follow their lead.
