Many argued that the current market-based system fails to ensure access, affordability, and quality, particularly for low-income individuals and those with chronic or complex health conditions.

Others raised concerns about the efficiency and quality of government-run systems, with a few opposing government involvement altogether, citing a preference for private sector solutions and skepticism about government performance.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme among supporters was the belief that denying healthcare based on financial ability is both unethical and detrimental to societal well-being. Concerns were also raised about long wait times and the need for timely access to care in a government-run system. Overall, the discussion reflected a strong consensus that the current system is inadequate and that a government-led approach could better serve the public interest.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
