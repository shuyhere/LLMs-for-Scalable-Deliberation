Supporters frequently mention the need for herd immunity, the greater good, and the role of science in guiding these decisions.</p>\n<p>However, a significant portion of comments oppose enforced vaccination, citing concerns over personal freedom, distrust in government or vaccine safety, and the belief that medical choices should remain individual. Some opposition is rooted in negative experiences during recent epidemics, such as concerns over rapid vaccine development or perceived government overreach. Quarantine measures tend to receive broader acceptance even among those who oppose vaccine mandates.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset expresses conditional support, advocating for measures only in truly severe situations, with proven vaccine efficacy, or if vaccines are accessible and free. Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between communal health priorities and individual rights, with varied perspectives on trust, effectiveness, and ethical implications.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
