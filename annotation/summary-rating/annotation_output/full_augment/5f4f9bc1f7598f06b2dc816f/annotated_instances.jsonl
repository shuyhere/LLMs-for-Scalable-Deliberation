A common theme is the belief that tipping should be optional and based on the quality of service, rather than being a default expectation or a mandatory addition to the bill. Some argue that the tipping culture has become over-extended, with tips now expected for services that traditionally did not include them, such as takeout or self-service.</p>\n<p>Several commenters criticize the low base wages of tipped workers and suggest that the responsibility for fair compensation should fall on employers, not customers. There is a strong sentiment that tipped workers should be paid a livable wage, and that tipping should not be a substitute for fair employment practices. A few commenters reference how other countries handle service compensation, suggesting that integrating a service charge into the bill could be a more transparent and fair approach.</p>\n<p>Some propose alternative models, such as fixed tipping amounts, service-based tipping (only for services that require direct interaction), or the complete abolition of the tipping system in favor of a standardized service charge. Others suggest that tipping should be a gesture of gratitude rather than an obligation, with no expectation of it being included in the transaction.</p>\n<p>While a minority of commenters support the current system or believe it should be encouraged to help service workers, most agree that the tipping system needs reform to be more equitable for both workers and customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
