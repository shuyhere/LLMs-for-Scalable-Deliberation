The most prevalent argument is a moral one, with many commenters framing healthcare as a fundamental human right that should not be a luxury dependent on a person's ability to pay. Several participants believe it is a core function and duty of the government to ensure the well-being of its population.</p>\n<p>Many also point to the failures of the current market-based system, citing prohibitive costs, lack of access, and poor health outcomes despite high spending. The for-profit nature of the existing system was criticized for creating incentives to deny care. Several commenters drew comparisons to other developed nations that provide universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. should do the same. Economic arguments were also made, noting that a healthier populace would be more competitive in the global economy.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, some of it is conditional. A portion of supporters specified that they would prefer a government-provided \"public option\" that exists alongside private insurance, preserving consumer choice. Others emphasized that their support depends on the quality and timeliness of the care provided. There was also a distinction made between providing \"basic\" care, which was widely supported, and \"extensive\" care, which raised concerns for some.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of comments expressed opposition to the idea. The reasoning for this dissent was based on a belief that the government is inefficient and that quality of care would suffer under a public system, arguing that the private sector is better equipped to manage healthcare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
