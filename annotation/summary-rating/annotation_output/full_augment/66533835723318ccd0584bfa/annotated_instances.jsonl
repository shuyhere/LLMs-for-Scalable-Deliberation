Others argued that tipping should be a voluntary gesture of appreciation rather than an expectation.</p>\n<p>There was also acknowledgment that tipping can be beneficial when it reflects genuine gratitude for good service, but it should not be a financial burden on customers or a substitute for fair compensation for workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
