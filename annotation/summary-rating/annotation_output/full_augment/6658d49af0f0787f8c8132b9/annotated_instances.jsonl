Common complaints include the expansion of tipping requests to establishments that traditionally didn't ask for tips, such as counter service, pickup orders, and basic transactions. Many feel that point-of-sale systems with preset tip options create uncomfortable pressure to tip even when minimal or no service is provided. Respondents frequently described feeling \"bullied,\" \"forced,\" or \"manipulated\" into tipping.</p>\n<h3>Support for Fair Wages Over Tips</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improvement was eliminating or reducing reliance on tipping by requiring employers to pay living wages. Many participants view the current system as a way for businesses to shift their responsibility for fair compensation onto customers. Several respondents noted that only the United States has this extensive tipping culture and suggested adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included or workers receive adequate base pay.</p>\n<h3>Conditional Support for Tipping</h3>\n<p>While most respondents tip regularly, many believe it should be reserved for exceptional service rather than expected for every transaction. About a quarter of participants support tipping when it rewards good service at full-service restaurants or for delivery, but oppose expanding it to counter service or automated transactions. Some respondents who worked for tips themselves still advocate for system reform.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on Appropriate Tipping Scenarios</h3>\n<p>Participants generally agree that tipping is most appropriate for:\n- Full-service restaurant servers\n- Food delivery drivers\n- Services involving direct, personalized attention</p>\n<p>They typically oppose tipping for:\n- Counter service or pickup orders\n- Pre-packaged items\n- Fast food establishments\n- Situations where no actual service is provided</p>\n<h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>\n<p>Common proposals include:\n- Establishing living wages for all workers (most frequent suggestion)\n- Making tipping truly optional without pressure\n- Implementing flat service charges instead of variable tips\n- Limiting tip requests to traditional service roles\n- Improving point-of-sale interfaces to make declining tips easier\n- Creating clearer guidelines about when tipping is appropriate</p>\n<p>A minority of respondents support the current system, viewing tips as motivation for good service or a way to help underpaid workers.

Many feel uncomfortable being asked, dislike pre-service tipping prompts, and want tipping to return to a voluntary expression of appreciation rather than an expectation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compensation and fairness: Strong support for employers paying a livable base wage (at least the standard minimum, with several calling for around $15/hour) so workers don\u2019t rely on tips. Many would abolish tipping entirely if wages were raised; others would keep tipping as a bonus for exceptional service. Several call out the subminimum tipped wage as unjust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatives to traditional tipping:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Replace tipping with a built-in service charge (often suggested around 10%) or integrate it into menu prices.</li>\n<li>Make tipping optional on top of a service charge, not pre-printed on the bill.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adopt practices seen in Europe or Japan where tipping is minimal or embedded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scope and norms:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Limit tipping primarily to full-service restaurants and clear service work (serving, bussing), not for pickup, drive-thru, fast food, coffee counters, or self-service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not prompt for tips before service is delivered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to tip when it remains:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Tie tips to quality of service; many endorse tipping generously for good service and withholding or reducing for poor service.</li>\n<li>Mixed views on calculation: most prefer percentages; a minority prefer fixed amounts or standardized guidance. One view suggests standardizing tip levels to avoid manipulation or confusion.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few suggest not taxing tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System and UX improvements:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Make \u201cno tip\u201d or \u201ccustom tip\u201d easy to find on POS screens; avoid coercive default percentages.</li>\n<li>Show tipping options only when a clear service has been provided.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some propose small thank-you gestures (notes, coupons) to acknowledge tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority views:</p>\n</li>\n<li>A small portion support mandatory tipping or fixed service charges everywhere, or believe patrons should not use tipped services if they can\u2019t tip.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few are strongly pro-tipping as an incentive and always tip at least 20%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Underlying themes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Concern about employer cost-shifting onto customers, tip inflation, and unclear expectations.</li>\n<li>Recognition that, under current U.S. norms, tips remain essential for many workers\u2019 income, even among those who want long-term structural change.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
