The primary arguments in favor are rooted in humanitarianism and empathy, with commenters noting that they would want a safe place to go if in a similar situation. Supporters emphasize a moral obligation to help innocent people, especially children, who are seeking a better life away from violence they did not choose.</p>\n<p>However, even among those who agree in principle, there are significant caveats. A common theme is the need for a thorough vetting process to ensure security and to verify that individuals meet the qualifications for refugee status. Others mentioned the importance of setting limits on the number of refugees and providing education to help them integrate into American society.</p>\n<p>A notable portion of commenters oppose accepting more refugees, primarily due to economic concerns. The main argument is that the country should prioritize its own citizens and address internal issues like national debt and poverty before taking on the responsibility of caring for others. These commenters believe that accepting more refugees places an undue strain on national resources and social systems, and some perceive it as unfair that aid might go to newcomers while citizens in need are overlooked.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
