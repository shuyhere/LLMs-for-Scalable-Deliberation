The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass the increased costs of imported goods onto them. Several participants noted that this increases the cost of living, hurts household budgets, and could lead to reduced consumer spending, potentially causing a recession. Small business owners mentioned being personally affected by the inability to afford products and resources from overseas. Other negative consequences mentioned include damaging international relationships, causing retaliatory tariffs from other nations, creating economic uncertainty, and isolating the U.S. from global trade. Some view the policy as ineffective, arguing it fails to reshore jobs and that companies will find ways around it or simply absorb the cost.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of commenters believe the policy will have a positive impact. The primary argument in favor is that tariffs level the playing field with other countries that have taken advantage of the U.S. for years. These participants feel the policy will protect domestic industries, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, and ultimately strengthen the economy and benefit the national budget. Some expressed trust in the administration's business expertise, believing the policy is a strategic long-term plan for a stronger future.</p>\n<p>A few participants offered a more nuanced view, suggesting the effects are mixed or will change over time. Several commenters acknowledged that there would be negative short-term consequences, such as price increases, but believe that in the long run, the policy could lead to better trade deals and a stronger domestic economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
