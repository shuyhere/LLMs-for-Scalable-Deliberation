A central theme among supporters was the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a privilege tied to income or job status. Many emphasized that the U.S. lags behind other developed nations in healthcare accessibility and affordability, and that the current system disproportionately burdens low-income individuals, leading to financial hardship, preventable illness, and even bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Supporters often cited the success of universal healthcare systems in other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, as evidence that such a model can work effectively. They also highlighted the societal and economic benefits of a healthier population, including improved productivity, reduced long-term healthcare costs, and better public health outcomes. Many argued that the government has a moral and civic duty to ensure that all citizens have access to basic healthcare, especially given the high tax revenue and resources available in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Some comments advocated for a public option alongside private insurance to maintain choice, while others called for a complete shift to a government-run system. A common concern among supporters was the role of for-profit healthcare corporations, which they believed prioritize profits over patient care.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller portion of the comments opposed government-provided healthcare. Opponents raised concerns about government inefficiency, potential increases in wait times, and the risk of reduced quality of care. Some expressed a preference for private healthcare and individual responsibility, while others worried about the financial burden on taxpayers and the possibility of reduced incentives for innovation in the medical field.</p>\n<p>Despite these concerns, the overwhelming sentiment was in favor of government-provided basic health insurance. Many argued that the current system is unsustainable and inhumane, and that universal healthcare is a necessary step toward a more just and equitable society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
