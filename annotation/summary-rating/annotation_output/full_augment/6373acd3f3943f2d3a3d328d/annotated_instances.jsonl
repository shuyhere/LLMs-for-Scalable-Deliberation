Most comments convey anger, worry, or frustration; a smaller share express confidence in the decision or in the need for reform; a few are uncertain due to lack of information.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
