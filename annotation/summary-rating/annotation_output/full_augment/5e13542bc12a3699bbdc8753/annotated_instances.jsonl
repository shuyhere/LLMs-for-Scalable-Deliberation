Supporters argued that such measures are essential for <strong>public health, preventing the spread of disease, and protecting the greater good</strong>. Many referenced the <strong>experience of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> as a justification, emphasizing the importance of <strong>herd immunity, reducing harm, and ensuring national survival</strong> in extreme circumstances. Some acknowledged that enforcement should be <strong>conditional on the severity of the epidemic and the proven effectiveness of the vaccines</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a considerable number of comments <strong>opposed</strong> government enforcement. Opponents raised concerns about <strong>individual rights, bodily autonomy, and the lack of long-term data on vaccine safety</strong>, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic. Some expressed <strong>distrust in government transparency and decision-making</strong>, citing examples where <strong>mandatory measures were perceived as harmful or poorly executed</strong>. Others emphasized that <strong>people should have the freedom to make their own health choices</strong>, even if it risks public health outcomes.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset of comments took a <strong>conditional stance</strong>, supporting enforcement <strong>only in specific circumstances</strong> or with <strong>additional safeguards</strong> such as public education, transparency, and voluntary options.</p>\n<p>In summary, the discussion reflects a <strong>tension between public health imperatives and individual rights</strong>, with strong arguments on both sides.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
