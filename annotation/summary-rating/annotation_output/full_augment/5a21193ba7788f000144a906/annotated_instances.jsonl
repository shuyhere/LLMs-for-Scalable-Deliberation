A significant portion of respondents express frustration with the current state of tipping culture in the United States.</p>\n<h6>Main Concerns About Current Tipping System</h6>\n<p>Many respondents feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, particularly with the proliferation of digital payment systems that prompt for tips in situations where they were not traditionally expected. Common complaints include being asked to tip for minimal service (such as picking up takeout orders or purchasing pre-made items), feeling pressured by point-of-sale systems, and the expansion of tipping requests beyond traditional service industries.</p>\n<h6>Support for Fair Wages</h6>\n<p>A dominant theme throughout the comments is the belief that workers should receive livable wages from their employers rather than relying on tips for income. Many respondents view the current system as a way for businesses to avoid paying fair wages, shifting the burden to consumers. The particularly low base wage for tipped workers (especially the $2.13/hour for servers) is frequently cited as problematic.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on When Tipping is Appropriate</h6>\n<p>While views vary, many respondents distinguish between situations where tipping feels appropriate versus excessive. Generally, people are more comfortable tipping for:\n- Full-service restaurant dining\n- Food delivery\n- Services where workers provide direct, personal attention</p>\n<p>Conversely, respondents often object to tipping for:\n- Counter service or takeout orders\n- Self-service situations\n- Minimal interaction transactions</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most commonly suggested improvements include:\n- Eliminating tipping entirely and ensuring all workers receive fair wages\n- Making tipping truly optional rather than expected\n- Implementing automatic service charges instead of tips\n- Limiting tip requests to traditional service roles\n- Improving point-of-sale systems to make declining tips easier</p>\n<h6>Cultural Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Several respondents reference international models, particularly European and Japanese systems, where tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. These alternatives are generally viewed favorably as more straightforward and fair to both workers and consumers.</p>\n<p>While a minority of respondents strongly support the current tipping system as a way to reward good service and potentially allow workers to earn above minimum wage, the overall sentiment leans toward reform, with most expressing a desire for a system that ensures fair compensation without relying on customer generosity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
