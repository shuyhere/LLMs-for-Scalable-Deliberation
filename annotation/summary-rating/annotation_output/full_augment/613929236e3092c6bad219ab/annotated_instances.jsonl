Opponents argue that anonymity is essential for protecting vulnerable individuals, such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution, and express distrust in both tech companies and governments handling sensitive information. They also fear increased risks of harassment, doxxing, or real-world consequences if identities are exposed.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments support the requirement, emphasizing accountability and reduced harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, and impersonation. Supporters believe real-name registration could foster more responsible online interactions and enhance credibility.</p>\n<p>Some participants express mixed or conditional views, suggesting compromises such as optional real-name use, verification systems for public figures, or backend registration without public display. A few acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks, indicating that context (e.g., platform vs. government enforcement) influences their stance.
