Some express that anonymity is a fundamental right online, allowing for free expression without fear of real-world consequences, such as job loss or social shunning.

There is also skepticism about enforcement, with worries that it could lead to intrusive ID requests or increased risks of identity theft if data breaches occur.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commentators support real-name registration, arguing that it would increase accountability and reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Proponents believe that linking online actions to real identities would encourage more responsible behavior and make it easier to address issues like impersonation or bot accounts. Some suggest compromises, such as allowing pseudonyms while verifying identities privately or providing verification badges for those who opt in.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation reflects a tension between the desire for a safer, more trustworthy online environment and the need to protect privacy, free expression, and safety for all users.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
