Many feel uncomfortable being asked, dislike pre-service tipping prompts, and want tipping to return to a voluntary expression of appreciation rather than an expectation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compensation and fairness: Strong support for employers paying a livable base wage (at least the standard minimum, with several calling for around $15/hour) so workers don\u2019t rely on tips. Many would abolish tipping entirely if wages were raised; others would keep tipping as a bonus for exceptional service. Several call out the subminimum tipped wage as unjust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatives to traditional tipping:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Replace tipping with a built-in service charge (often suggested around 10%) or integrate it into menu prices.</li>\n<li>Make tipping optional on top of a service charge, not pre-printed on the bill.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adopt practices seen in Europe or Japan where tipping is minimal or embedded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scope and norms:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Limit tipping primarily to full-service restaurants and clear service work (serving, bussing), not for pickup, drive-thru, fast food, coffee counters, or self-service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not prompt for tips before service is delivered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to tip when it remains:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Tie tips to quality of service; many endorse tipping generously for good service and withholding or reducing for poor service.</li>\n<li>Mixed views on calculation: most prefer percentages; a minority prefer fixed amounts or standardized guidance. One view suggests standardizing tip levels to avoid manipulation or confusion.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few suggest not taxing tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>System and UX improvements:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Make \u201cno tip\u201d or \u201ccustom tip\u201d easy to find on POS screens; avoid coercive default percentages.</li>\n<li>Show tipping options only when a clear service has been provided.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some propose small thank-you gestures (notes, coupons) to acknowledge tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority views:</p>\n</li>\n<li>A small portion support mandatory tipping or fixed service charges everywhere, or believe patrons should not use tipped services if they can\u2019t tip.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few are strongly pro-tipping as an incentive and always tip at least 20%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Underlying themes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Concern about employer cost-shifting onto customers, tip inflation, and unclear expectations.</li>\n<li>Recognition that, under current U.S. norms, tips remain essential for many workers\u2019 income, even among those who want long-term structural change.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
