Many argue education is foundational to a healthy society and economy, and cuts are seen as short-sighted and harmful to students, educators, and the country\u2019s long-term competitiveness. Commonly cited risks include reduced access and equity (especially for low-income families), weakened public schools, stalled research and innovation (notably in medical fields), brain drain to other countries, skill gaps in the workforce, and diminished social mobility. Some also raise concerns about undermining trust in institutions and question the legality if funds were already appropriated by Congress.\n- Motivations ascribed to the policy: Critics frequently characterize the move as politically motivated, punitive, or authoritarian, intended to keep the public less informed or to divert resources elsewhere. Supporters counter that academia has become ideologically biased (left-leaning/DEI \u201cindoctrination\u201d), and believe trimming funding could curb misuse, reduce costs inflated by subsidies, and encourage reform or more local control.\n- Minority supportive view: A smaller share supports targeted or broader cuts, citing waste, federal inefficiency, tuition inflation tied to subsidies, and confidence that alternative solutions or reforms will follow. A few suggest cuts could spur overdue overhauls.\n- Neutral/uncertain: A small portion express limited knowledge or no strong feelings, emphasizing the need for details.\n- Areas of convergence: Even among those open to reductions, there is emphasis on protecting core educational access and critical research, pursuing targeted efficiencies rather than sweeping cuts, and balancing fiscal restraint with investment in long-term national capacity.\n- Tone: Highly polarized, with much of the commentary using strong language to condemn the decision, while a smaller contingent endorses cuts on ideological and efficiency grounds.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 50, "num_samples_group_b": 10, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary:\n- Predominant view: Strong opposition to cutting academic funding.
