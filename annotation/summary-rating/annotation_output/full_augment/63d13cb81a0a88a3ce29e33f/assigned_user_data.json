Commenters frequently state that offering refuge is the \"right thing to do,\" driven by empathy and compassion for innocent people, including children and families, escaping life-threatening situations. Many believe that everyone has a right to safety and a chance to rebuild their lives.

These commenters advocate for a balanced approach that ensures the needs of current citizens are met and that there are limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negative economic impacts or competition for services.\n*   <strong>Integration:</strong> Some suggest the need for programs to help refugees integrate into American society.\n*   <strong>Distinctions:</strong> A few participants specified that their support is for \"genuine\" refugees fleeing danger, not for economic migrants.</p>\n<p><strong>Arguments in Opposition</strong>\nOpposition to accepting more refugees is rooted in the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens and domestic problems first. These commenters argue that the country is already facing significant economic challenges, including national debt and citizens who are struggling. They express concern that accepting more refugees places an additional strain on social systems and government expenditures, and that resources are being diverted from Americans in need.
