Many note that tipping requests now appear in situations where they previously didn't exist - such as pickup orders, fast food establishments, and basic transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with preset tipping options has created uncomfortable pressure to tip even when minimal or no service is provided.</p>\n<h3>Perspectives on System Reform</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improvement is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure workers receive livable wages directly from employers. Many view the current system as a way for businesses to underpay employees while shifting the burden to customers. Some propose a middle ground approach, such as implementing a standard service charge (with suggestions ranging from 10% to amounts included in menu prices) similar to practices in other countries like Japan and Europe.</p>\n<h3>Views on When Tipping is Appropriate</h3>\n<p>While there's general agreement that tipping should reward good service, opinions diverge on where it belongs. Most accept tipping in full-service restaurants where servers provide table service, but many object to its expansion into counter service, takeout, and other minimal-service contexts. Several emphasize that tipping should be voluntary and based on service quality, not mandatory or expected.</p>\n<h3>Worker Compensation Concerns</h3>\n<p>A recurring theme is sympathy for service workers who depend on tips due to sub-minimum wages (particularly the $2.13/hour for tipped workers). Many acknowledge this creates financial instability for workers while also burdening customers. The consensus leans toward raising base wages to eliminate workers' dependence on tips, though some appreciate that the current system can allow exceptional servers to earn above minimum wage.</p>\n<h3>Cultural and Practical Considerations</h3>\n<p>Several comments highlight that the United States' tipping culture is unique globally, suggesting the country could learn from other nations' approaches. Practical concerns include the awkwardness of declining to tip on digital screens, confusion about appropriate tip amounts, and the stress of calculating tips. A minority view appreciates tipping as an incentive for good service or as a way to show gratitude.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a desire for significant reform of the tipping system, with most favoring either its elimination or substantial modification to reduce pressure on consumers while ensuring fair compensation for workers.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Partially represented \u2014 main idea but gaps": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Very informative \u2014 most details included": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Completely neutral \u2014 fully impartial": "5"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?

Many express frustration with the increasing prevalence of tipping in situations where it is not traditionally expected, such as for takeout or self-service. There is a common sentiment that tipping should be tied to the quality of service, with several commenters suggesting that tipping should be voluntary and not used as a substitute for fair wages.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback calls for the elimination of the tipping system altogether, arguing that it places undue pressure on customers and often masks low wages for service workers.
