Supporters express confidence in the business acumen behind the decisions and suggest that while immediate effects may seem challenging, the long-term benefits will become apparent. Some argue that the policy hasn't actually led to price increases or stifled imports as critics claim, and that it could help lift American workers out of poverty by prioritizing domestic interests.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those opposing the tariffs highlight significant concerns about immediate economic impacts. Critics point to price increases already being felt by consumers and worry about the disproportionate burden on small businesses. They argue that the policy damages international relationships, particularly with China, while failing to create meaningful job opportunities for American workers. Several commenters characterize the tariffs as benefiting primarily the wealthy while increasing the cost of living for average citizens. There's also concern that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading partners, potentially isolating the U.S. economically.</p>\n<p>The division appears roughly even, with passionate arguments on both sides. The fundamental disagreement centers on whether short-term economic disruption is worth potential long-term benefits, and whether the tariffs truly serve the interests of average Americans or primarily benefit a select few.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
