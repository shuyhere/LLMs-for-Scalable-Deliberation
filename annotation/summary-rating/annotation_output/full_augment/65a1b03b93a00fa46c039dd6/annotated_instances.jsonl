Many express concern that tariffs function as a tax passed directly to consumers, reducing purchasing power and potentially leading to decreased spending, job losses, and broader economic instability.

The overarching sentiment leans toward skepticism regarding the policy's effectiveness and fairness, with emphasis on its disproportionate impact on average consumers and smaller enterprises.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
