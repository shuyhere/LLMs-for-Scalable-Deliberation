Below is a summary of the key themes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Abolishing the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   A significant portion of the comments advocate for the complete elimination of the tipping system. Many argue that tipping is an unfair burden on consumers and that it allows employers to underpay their workers. Some suggest replacing it with a fixed service charge (e.g., 10%) or integrating it into the overall cost of service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improving the Tipping System</strong><br />\n   Several respondents propose reforms rather than elimination. These include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Making tipping optional and only for services that clearly involve direct, personal interaction (e.g., full-service restaurants).</li>\n<li>Ensuring that tipping is based on the quality of service, not just expectation or convenience.</li>\n<li>Encouraging fixed-amount tipping (e.g., $20 or $30) instead of percentage-based tipping to standardize and simplify the process.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customers with a tangible benefit for tipping, such as a thank-you note or a coupon for future use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fair Wages for Service Workers</strong><br />\n   A recurring theme is the need for service workers to be paid a fair, livable wage, regardless of tips. Many argue that the current system forces employees to rely on customer generosity, which is unpredictable and unfair. There is strong support for raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and eliminating the subminimum wage in the U.S.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Social Norms</strong><br />\n   Some commenters express frustration with the overextension of the tipping culture, noting that it is now expected for almost every service, including takeout, drive-thru, and even self-service transactions. This has led to a sense of pressure or obligation, which many find uncomfortable or exploitative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Form of Appreciation</strong><br />\n   A number of individuals support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be voluntary and based on the quality of the experience. Some even overtip in appreciation for the effort and skill of service workers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technology and Consumer Experience</strong><br />\n   A few comments mention the role of technology in making tipping more intrusive, such as default tipping prompts on point-of-sale systems.

These models are often cited as more equitable and less stressful for both workers and consumers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moral and Ethical Concerns</strong><br />\n   There is a sense of moral obligation for both workers and customers.
