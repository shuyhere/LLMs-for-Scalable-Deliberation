There is strong support for eliminating the system altogether or fundamentally restructuring it by ensuring service workers receive a living wage from their employers, thus reducing their reliance on tips. Many suggest that tipping should be a voluntary gesture of gratitude for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to low wages.</p>\n<p>There is also notable criticism of point-of-sale systems that make skipping a tip difficult or awkward, with calls for a simpler and more transparent \"no tip\" option. Some propose alternative models, such as incorporating a standard service charge into prices or shifting to fixed tip amounts instead of percentages. A minority of comments support tipping as a beneficial practice for workers, but even these often express a desire for it to be more genuinely optional and directly tied to service quality rather than feeling obligatory. Overall, the sentiment leans heavily toward systemic change that prioritizes fair wages from employers and re-establishes tipping as a truly discretionary act of appreciation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
