A majority of the comments express support for accepting refugees, often grounded in humanitarian principles, moral responsibility, and the belief in the U.S. as a nation of refuge and opportunity. Supporters emphasize compassion, the right to safety, and the historical legacy of the United States as a place of asylum. Many also highlight the importance of maintaining rigorous vetting processes to ensure security and to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants.</p>\n<p>Some comments express conditional support, advocating for refugee acceptance only if it does not negatively impact domestic resources, economic stability, or the well-being of current citizens. Others suggest that the U.S. should focus on resolving internal issues before expanding refugee programs.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments oppose accepting more refugees. These perspectives often cite concerns about overpopulation, strain on public resources, and the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens. A few commenters argue that refugees should seek refuge in neighboring countries rather than in the U.S., or that the country is not in a financial or social position to support more refugees.</p>\n<p>Across the spectrum, there is a common theme of balancing humanitarian values with practical considerations, and many commenters acknowledge the complexity of the issue.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
