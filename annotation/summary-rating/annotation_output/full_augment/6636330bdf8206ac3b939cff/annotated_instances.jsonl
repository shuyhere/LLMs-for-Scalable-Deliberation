A key concern is the <strong>invasion of privacy</strong>, with many arguing that such a policy would expose users to <strong>safety risks</strong>, <strong>harassment</strong>, and <strong>unwanted attention</strong>, especially for vulnerable groups such as those experiencing domestic abuse or individuals with politically sensitive views. There is also significant concern about <strong>data misuse</strong>, including the potential for <strong>personal information to be sold or hacked</strong>, leading to identity theft or other malicious activities.</p>\n<p>Some commenters acknowledge <strong>potential benefits</strong>, such as increased <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>reduced cyberbullying</strong>, and <strong>less fraudulent behavior</strong>. However, these perceived advantages are often weighed against the <strong>loss of anonymity</strong>, which is seen as essential for free expression, especially for those who rely on pseudonymity to express themselves safely or share sensitive information.</p>\n<p>A few commenters suggest a <strong>middle ground</strong>, such as allowing real-name verification in the background while permitting users to maintain a <strong>public persona</strong> or nickname. This approach is seen as a way to balance accountability with privacy.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward <strong>valuing anonymity and online privacy</strong> as fundamental rights, with many emphasizing that the <strong>risks of real-name registration outweigh the benefits</strong> in today\u2019s digital landscape.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
