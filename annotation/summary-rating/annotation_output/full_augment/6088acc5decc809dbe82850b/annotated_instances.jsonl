Many express that frequent updates provide improved performance, better security, and innovative features, which are seen as necessary in today's fast-paced world. However, a majority voice strong criticisms, highlighting that the cycle encourages planned obsolescence, places financial pressure on consumers to upgrade frequently, and contributes substantially to electronic waste.</p>\n<p>There is a widespread perception that manufacturers prioritize releasing new products over perfecting existing ones, often with only incremental changes that do not justify the high costs or the environmental impact. Concerns about sustainability, repairability, and the creation of unnecessary electronic waste are prominent. Many suggest that a slower, more deliberate update cycle\u2014such as every two to three years\u2014would be more beneficial, allowing for more meaningful innovations and reducing consumer and environmental strain.
