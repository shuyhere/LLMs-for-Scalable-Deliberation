A significant portion of the feedback expresses opposition to such a policy, often citing concerns about privacy, safety, and the potential misuse of personal data. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression, particularly for individuals in vulnerable situations such as those experiencing domestic abuse or individuals with politically unpopular views. Others worry that requiring real names could lead to increased cyberbullying, harassment, and the exposure of sensitive personal information, especially if platforms are hacked or data is sold to third parties.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller but notable portion of the comments support real-name registration, emphasizing the potential for greater accountability, reduced harassment, and improved trust on social media platforms. Some suggest a middle ground, such as allowing users to maintain pseudonyms for public interactions while verifying real identities for internal platform use.</p>\n<p>Several commenters also highlight the importance of context\u2014such as who is enforcing the policy (e.g., the platform versus the government)\u2014as a key factor in determining whether the practice is acceptable.</p>\n<p>Overall, the majority of the comments lean toward opposition or caution, with a strong emphasis on the value of online anonymity and the risks associated with requiring real-name registration.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
