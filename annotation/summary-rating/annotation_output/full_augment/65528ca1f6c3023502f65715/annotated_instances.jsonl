Many describe feeling uncomfortable or bullied by the proliferation of digital point-of-sale systems that prominently feature tipping options.</p>\n<p>There is overwhelming support for the idea that employers should pay a living wage to service workers, making them less reliant on tips for their income. A significant portion of commenters suggest that the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with the employer, not the customer.

Some advocate for the complete elimination of tipping, while others believe it should remain as a voluntary gesture for exceptional service.
