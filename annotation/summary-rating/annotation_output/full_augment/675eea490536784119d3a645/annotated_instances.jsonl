Some highlight the potential consequences, such as the loss of academic talent to other countries, reduced quality of education, and increased financial burdens on students and educators.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments suggest support for or understanding of the decision, often citing concerns about the political leanings of academic institutions or expressing confidence in the decision-maker\u2019s rationale.
