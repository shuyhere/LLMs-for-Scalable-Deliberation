The overarching themes include significant apprehension about immediate consumer costs and skepticism about the policy's effectiveness, alongside hope for structural economic improvements in the long run.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
