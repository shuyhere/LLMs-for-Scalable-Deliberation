Many argue that the current system allows businesses to underpay employees and shifts the financial responsibility onto customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Forced Tipping:</strong><br />\n   Several commenters are critical of the increasing prevalence of mandatory or suggested tipping, particularly in situations where direct service is minimal or nonexistent (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail). They find it uncomfortable or unfair to be pressured into tipping in these contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Reward for Service:</strong><br />\n   Many commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be optional and based on the quality of service provided.
