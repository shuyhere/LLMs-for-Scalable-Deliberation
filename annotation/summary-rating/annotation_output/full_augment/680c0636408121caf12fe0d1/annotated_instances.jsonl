Some frame the cuts as politically motivated or authoritarian; a few argue that perceived ideological bias in universities justifies targeted reductions.\n- Several commenters call for addressing waste without undermining core investments, or for providing alternative solutions if cuts occur. One person notes they need more details before forming an opinion.\n- A few raise broader social implications, such as fears that resources may be redirected to policing with harmful effects on marginalized communities, while others express trust that leadership has valid reasons. Some note the risk of eroding trust in institutions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
