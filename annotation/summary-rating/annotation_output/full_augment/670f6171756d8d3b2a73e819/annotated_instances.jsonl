Many argued that tariffs function as a tax on American citizens, as companies pass the increased costs on, leading to higher prices, inflation, and a greater cost of living. Several commenters also highlighted the damage to international relations, stating the policy hurts relationships with trading partners like China, isolates the U.S., and could provoke retaliatory tariffs. The negative impact on small businesses was another frequently cited issue. Some also questioned the policy's effectiveness, believing it would not succeed in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who see the policy as a positive measure often focus on its potential long-term benefits. A common belief is that while there may be short-term difficulties, the tariffs are a necessary correction to unfair trade practices that have disadvantaged the U.S. for years. These supporters believe the policy will encourage consumers to buy American-made goods, make U.S. products more competitive, and ultimately strengthen the economy. Some expressed confidence in the administration's business strategy to secure a better future for the country.</p>\n<p>A few commenters offered a more mixed or neutral perspective, suggesting the policy has both positive and negative consequences or that its impact is minimal because companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
