This was described as a direct financial burden on everyday Americans, increasing inflation and making it harder for people to afford essentials. Several participants noted the detrimental effect on international relations, stating that the policy hurts the U.S.'s relationship with trading partners, could lead to retaliatory tariffs, and isolates the country from global trade.
