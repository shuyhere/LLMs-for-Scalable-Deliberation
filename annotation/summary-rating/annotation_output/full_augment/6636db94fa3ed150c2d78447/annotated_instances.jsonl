A prevailing opinion is that tipping allows employers to pay unlivable wages, shifting the responsibility of compensating staff from the business to the customer. Consequently, the most common proposed solution is to eliminate the tipped minimum wage and require all businesses to pay their employees a fair, livable wage. Many express a willingness to pay higher prices for goods and services if it meant that workers were compensated fairly and tipping was no longer necessary.</p>\n<p>Another major point of frustration is the expansion of tipping requests into areas where they were not previously expected, such as for counter service, pickup orders, and other transactions involving minimal direct service. The proliferation of tablet point-of-sale systems, which often prompt for a tip by default, is frequently mentioned as a source of social pressure and discomfort.</p>\n<p>While some participants still support tipping as a voluntary reward for excellent service or as an incentive for employees to go above and beyond, the dominant sentiment is that it has become an obligation rather than a choice. Several alternative solutions were proposed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abolishing tipping entirely</strong> in favor of higher, more transparent wages.</li>\n<li>Implementing a <strong>mandatory, fixed service charge</strong> to provide more predictability.</li>\n<li>Making tipping <strong>truly optional and reserved only for exceptional service</strong>, rather than an expectation.</li>\n<li>Changing the format from percentages to <strong>fixed dollar amounts</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the consensus leans toward major reform, with the core belief that employers, not customers, should be responsible for providing their employees with a stable and livable income.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
