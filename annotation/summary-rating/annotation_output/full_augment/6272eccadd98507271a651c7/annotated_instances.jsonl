The most common reasons for support include increasing user accountability, which they believe would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, misinformation, and scams. Supporters also feel it would enhance authenticity by making it easier to identify and remove bots, fake accounts, and impersonators, thereby protecting users from fraud and identity theft. Some see it as a necessary step to protect minors and ensure people are held responsible for harmful behavior.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a majority of comments expressed opposition to a real-name requirement, citing major concerns about privacy, freedom, and safety. These individuals view the right to online anonymity as a fundamental freedom. A primary fear is the misuse of personal data; many do not trust social media companies to safeguard their information, worrying it could be sold, leaked in data breaches, or used by governments for surveillance. Opponents also argue that anonymity is a crucial safety tool for vulnerable individuals, such as domestic abuse survivors, political dissidents, or those who could face real-world consequences like job loss for their online opinions. Some believe a real-name policy could even worsen cyberbullying by providing attackers with a person's real identity.</p>\n<p>Several commenters took a more nuanced or conditional stance. They acknowledged the potential benefits of accountability but were unwilling to sacrifice privacy completely. Common suggestions for a middle ground included:\n*   Requiring identity verification on the back end for the platform's records while allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym.\n*   Making identity verification an optional feature that grants a user a \"verified\" status or checkmark, allowing others to gauge authenticity without making it mandatory for all.\n*   Distinguishing between a platform requiring a real name (seen as more acceptable by some) and a government mandate (seen as an overreach).</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
