A significant portion of commentators see these cuts as an attack on education that will weaken the country's future, hinder innovation, and reduce global competitiveness. Many connect the funding reduction to a broader political strategy to control the population by limiting education and keeping people less informed.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments support the cuts, primarily citing concerns over political bias in academia, administrative bloat, or the belief that universities misuse funds. A few others express uncertainty or a need for more details before forming an opinion.</p>\n<p>Common themes across the negative comments include fears of a \"brain drain,\" harm to low-income students, a decline in critical research (especially in medicine), and the long-term economic damage of an under-educated workforce.
