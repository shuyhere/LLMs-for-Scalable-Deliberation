Proponents believe that attaching real identities to online activity would deter negative actions like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of inflammatory speech. This group feels it would create a more responsible and credible online environment and help combat inauthentic accounts used for catfishing or impersonation.</p>\n<p>However, a larger percentage of participants opposed the requirement, citing major concerns about privacy, safety, and freedom. The most frequent argument against the proposal was that it represents a severe invasion of privacy, with many expressing distrust in how tech companies or governments would use, sell, or secure this personal data. Commenters also raised fears of real-world consequences, including job loss over political opinions, stalking, and increased risks for vulnerable individuals, such as victims of domestic abuse. The right to online anonymity was frequently defended as an important freedom for expression. Some also questioned the policy's effectiveness, suggesting it might not change behavior and could even worsen cyberbullying by making targets easier to identify.</p>\n<p>Several participants offered nuanced views or alternative solutions. A popular middle-ground suggestion was to require identity verification on the backend for the platform's records, while still allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym. This would enable platforms to address malicious behavior without eliminating public anonymity. Other ideas included making real-name use optional or creating a voluntary verification system (e.g., a checkmark) to differentiate authenticated accounts.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion reveals a fundamental tension between the desire for a safer online public square and the protection of individual privacy and the freedom of anonymous expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
