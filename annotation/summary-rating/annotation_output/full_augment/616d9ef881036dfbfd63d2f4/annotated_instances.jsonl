A significant proportion of commenters oppose the requirement, expressing concerns about privacy, safety, and potential misuse of personal data. Many argue that anonymity is essential for protecting vulnerable individuals, such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution, and fear that real-name policies could lead to increased risks like doxxing, identity theft, or harassment. Others highlight distrust in social media companies or governments to handle personal information responsibly, citing risks of data breaches or unauthorized sales of data.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commenters support real-name registration, emphasizing accountability and safety benefits. They argue that it could reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and harmful behavior by making users more responsible for their online actions. Some also suggest it could help combat issues like impersonation, bot accounts, or criminal activities such as human trafficking. A few commenters propose compromises, such as allowing pseudonyms publicly while verifying identities privately or implementing verification badges for authenticity.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion reflects a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the need to protect privacy and free expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
