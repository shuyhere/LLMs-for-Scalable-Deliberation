Roughly 55% are critical, 35% express mixed views, and about 10% are broadly positive.</p>\n<p>Key themes:\n- Recognized benefits: frequent innovation, better performance (especially cameras), timely security patches, and the convenience of ever-improving tech.\n- Main concerns: perceived planned obsolescence and pressure to upgrade, diminishing year\u2011over\u2011year gains, bugs after updates, shorter device lifespans due to dropped software support, rising costs (exacerbated by supply-chain and tariff issues), changing chargers/accessories, privacy worries with data tracking, and environmental impacts from e\u2011waste.\n- User preferences: a slower cadence (often 2\u20133 years) with bigger, more meaningful improvements; longer software support; greater durability, repairability, and standardization of accessories; stronger focus on refining existing products; and clearer separation of essential security updates from optional feature upgrades.\n- Outlook: Several expect the cycle to naturally decelerate as the technology matures and improvements become less noticeable between generations.</p>\n<p>In short, while rapid updates showcase technological progress and security benefits, many want a more sustainable, consumer-friendly rhythm that prioritizes longevity, stability, and environmental responsibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
