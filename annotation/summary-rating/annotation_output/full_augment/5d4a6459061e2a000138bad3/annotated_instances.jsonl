Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. This comparison reinforces the view that the American tipping system is unique and potentially problematic.</p>\n<p>The consensus suggests strong dissatisfaction with how tipping culture has evolved, with most preferring either its elimination in favor of fair wages or its return to being a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to inadequate pay.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Mostly represented \u2014 most info, minor nuance missing": "4"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Very informative \u2014 most details included": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Completely neutral \u2014 fully impartial": "5"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?

A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current tipping system, particularly its perceived overreach into everyday transactions and the pressure it places on consumers. Many commenters argue that tipping has become a norm rather than a voluntary gesture, with some noting that it is increasingly expected even for minimal or no service\u2014such as for pickup orders, drive-thru, or simple retail transactions.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the idea that the tipping system is often used to justify low base wages for service workers. Many commenters advocate for the elimination of tipping in favor of a model where employees receive a fair, livable wage from their employers. Others suggest alternatives such as a fixed service charge added to the bill, similar to systems in place in other countries.</p>\n<p>For those who support tipping, it is often framed as a way to reward excellent service and show appreciation for workers. However, there is a clear consensus that tipping should be optional and tied directly to the quality of service provided, not as a requirement for receiving basic service.</p>\n<p>There is also concern about the way tipping is presented to consumers, particularly through point-of-sale systems that default to suggested tip amounts or make it difficult to leave no tip at all. Many commenters suggest that the system should be more transparent and less manipulative.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights the need for a more equitable and less intrusive approach to tipping. While some support its continued use for exceptional service, the majority believe that the system is broken and should be reformed or replaced with a model that ensures fair wages for workers without placing the financial burden on consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
