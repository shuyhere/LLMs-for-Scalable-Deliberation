About 83% express support, most on humanitarian grounds (safety, human rights, empathy), with some noting moral responsibility when U.S. foreign policy contributes and potential cultural or economic benefits. A substantial portion of supporters want guardrails: rigorous vetting and background checks, clear limits to match capacity, protections for public safety and the economy, integration support and civics education, and practical resettlement strategies (e.g., directing newcomers to rural areas or providing skills training).</p>\n<p>Roughly 17% oppose taking more refugees, emphasizing prioritizing current citizens, national debt, strain on social services, crowded cities, and the view that refugees should seek safety in neighboring countries. Some comments conflate refugee admissions with unauthorized immigration and perceive inequities in aid distribution. A small share is conflicted, offering conditional support tied to economic impact.</p>\n<p>In sum, the prevailing view favors accepting refugees on humanitarian grounds, paired with strong vetting, capacity-aware limits, and structured integration to balance compassion with domestic stability.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
