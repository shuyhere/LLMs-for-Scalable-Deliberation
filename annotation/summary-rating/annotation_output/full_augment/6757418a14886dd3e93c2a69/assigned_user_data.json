Many note that establishments that traditionally didn't request tips now do so through point-of-sale systems, creating uncomfortable situations where customers feel pressured to tip even for minimal or no service.

This creates an unfair burden on both workers and customers, with the tipping system essentially allowing employers to underpay their staff.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure all workers receive fair, livable wages.
