A majority of respondents express frustration with the pervasive and often mandatory nature of tipping, particularly for small transactions or services where it feels unwarranted. Many feel pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping at establishments that historically did not ask for gratuity.</p>\n<p>A prominent theme is the belief that employers should be responsible for paying a living wage, thereby reducing or eliminating workers' reliance on tips for their primary income. Several comments argue that this shift in responsibility from the customer to the employer would create a fairer system.</p>\n<p>Opinions on what constitutes appropriate tipping are varied. Some suggest tipping should be reserved exclusively for recognizing exceptional service, while others propose moving from a percentage-based system to a standardized fixed amount to ensure fairness, especially on smaller bills. A minority of comments also suggest that businesses could enhance the tipping experience by offering small tokens of appreciation, like thank-you notes or coupons, in return.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights a desire to move away from a culture of obligation and pressure, toward a system where tipping is a genuine, voluntary reward for excellent service, underpinned by employers providing a stable, livable wage.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
