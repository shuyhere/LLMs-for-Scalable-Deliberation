A significant portion of contributors express frustration with the expansion of tipping prompts to establishments where no traditional service is provided, describing it as uncomfortable and coercive. There is a notable sentiment that tipping should be a voluntary gesture for exceptional service, not an expected subsidy for low wages. Some suggest practical reforms like standardized fixed amounts or integrating service charges into pricing, while others reference European models where higher base pay makes tipping unnecessary. Despite the criticism, a minority view maintains that tipping is a valuable way to appreciate good service, though even this group often qualifies that it should not be mandatory. The overarching theme is a desire to shift financial responsibility from customers to employers while preserving the ability to voluntarily reward outstanding service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
