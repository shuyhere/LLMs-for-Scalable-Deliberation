A majority of respondents express frustration with the expectation of tipping for minimal or no service, particularly in transactions like picking up food or using point-of-sale systems where declining a tip is often cumbersome. Many believe that employers should pay a living wage, eliminating the need for workers to rely on tips for survival. There is support for making tipping truly voluntary and based solely on service quality, with some suggesting fixed amounts instead of percentages. Others propose replacing tipping with a mandatory service charge or higher menu prices to ensure fair compensation. While a minority view tipping as a positive incentive for good service, the prevailing sentiment is that the system is overly pressured, inequitable, and places undue burden on consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
