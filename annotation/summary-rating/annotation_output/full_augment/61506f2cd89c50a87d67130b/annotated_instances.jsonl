A significant portion of commenters believe these cuts will severely damage the foundational role of education, weaken the country's long-term competitiveness, and hinder critical research and innovation, particularly in fields like medicine. Many express concern that the policy unfairly harms students, especially those from lower-income backgrounds, and will lead to a \"brain drain\" as researchers seek opportunities in other countries.
