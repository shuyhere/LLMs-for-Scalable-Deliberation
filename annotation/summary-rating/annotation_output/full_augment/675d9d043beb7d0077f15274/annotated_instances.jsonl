Many feel pressured by tablet prompts and pre-service tip requests.\n- Compensation view: Broad agreement that employers should pay a fair, livable wage (ending the sub-minimum \u201ctipped wage\u201d), with tips treated as an optional bonus for good or exceptional service. Several would accept higher menu prices to fund wages.\n- System reform ideas: \n  - Abolish tipping entirely and fold compensation into prices or a built-in service charge (often cited around 10%).\n  - Keep tipping but make it clearly voluntary, merit-based, and limited mainly to full-service restaurants\u2014not pickup, fast food, or coffee counters.\n  - Standardize aspects (e.g., fixed tip amounts for small bills, clear guidelines by service level) or consider mandatory tips only if wages aren\u2019t livable.\n- Practical improvements: Show an easy \u201cno tip\u201d option, prompt only after service is delivered, and avoid aggressive default tip screens. Limit who is prompted for tips to roles providing direct service.\n- Minority perspectives: Some strongly defend tipping as an incentive and tip generously; a few suggest mandatory tipping or argue customers shouldn\u2019t use tipped services if they can\u2019t tip. Other niche suggestions include not taxing tips and offering small thank-you tokens or coupons in return.\n- Context: Several point to European/Japanese models\u2014higher wages or automatic service charges with minimal tipping\u2014as preferable.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
