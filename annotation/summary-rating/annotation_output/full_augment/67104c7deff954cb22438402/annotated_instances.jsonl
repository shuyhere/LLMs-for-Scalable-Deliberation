Many feel that anonymity is an important freedom and that requiring real names could lead to unwanted exposure, harassment, stalking, or even real-world consequences like job loss or violence.

Some support the idea only if implemented by platforms rather than governments, or suggest a compromise where real identities are verified but not publicly displayed\u2014such as through verification badges\u2014while allowing pseudonyms.
