A majority express support for accepting refugees, emphasizing humanitarian responsibility, moral duty, and the idea that offering refuge aligns with values of compassion and global solidarity. Many supporters reference the historical role of the United States as a nation of immigrants and its capacity to provide safety and opportunity.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents condition their support on thorough vetting processes to ensure security, prevent criminal elements from entering, and maintain control over immigration. They also stress the importance of integration efforts, such as education on societal norms.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some express opposition or hesitation, primarily due to concerns about economic strain, resource allocation, and the potential negative impact on existing citizens. These comments often argue that domestic issues should be prioritized before accepting more refugees, citing national debt, overcrowding, or insufficient support for current residents.</p>\n<p>A few comments acknowledge the complexity of the issue, noting that geopolitical factors, such as past foreign policies, may create a responsibility to accept refugees. Overall, the comments reflect a tension between humanitarian impulses and practical considerations about national capacity and security.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
