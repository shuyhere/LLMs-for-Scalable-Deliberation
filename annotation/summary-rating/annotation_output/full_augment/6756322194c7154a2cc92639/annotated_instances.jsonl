The most prevalent suggestion is for employers to be required to pay their employees a livable wage, thereby removing the workers' dependency on tips and shifting the responsibility of fair compensation from the customer back to the business.</p>\n<p>Many feel that tipping culture has become \"out of control,\" with tipping prompts appearing for minimal-service transactions where they were not previously expected. This expansion, often driven by tablet point-of-sale systems, creates a sense of pressure and obligation, making customers uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>While the desire to reform the system is strong, there is a recurring sentiment that tipping should be a voluntary act of gratitude for exceptional service, not a mandatory or expected supplement to a worker's wage. The quality of service is frequently cited as the key factor that should determine if a tip is warranted.</p>\n<p>A few unique suggestions for improving the system were also mentioned, such as changing from percentages to fixed-amount tips, integrating a compulsory service charge into the bill, or even having the customer receive a small token of appreciation, like a coupon, in exchange for a tip.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of participants view tipping more positively, seeing it as a necessary way to help underpaid workers and a good deed to show appreciation for their skills and effort.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
