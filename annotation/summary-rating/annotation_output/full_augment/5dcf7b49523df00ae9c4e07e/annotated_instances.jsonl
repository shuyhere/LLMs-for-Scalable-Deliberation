About 90% express support (including some who support it with conditions), while fewer than 10% oppose.</p>\n<p>Key reasons for support:\n- Healthcare framed as a human right and a core government responsibility to ensure safety, welfare, and fairness regardless of income or job status.\n- Current system seen as unaffordable and inequitable; private, for\u2011profit insurance viewed as incentivized to deny care.\n- Anticipated benefits include better access to preventive and early-detection care, improved health outcomes (including for autoimmune issues), reduced medical debt and bankruptcies, and stronger national competitiveness and security.\n- International comparisons: Other developed countries\u2019 universal models are cited as proof of feasibility; the U.S. is seen as an outlier.\n- Economic efficiency: Larger risk pools, less uncompensated care for hospitals, and more household spending freed from medical debt.</p>\n<p>Common conditions and caveats among supporters:\n- Preference for a public option alongside private plans rather than a single, mandatory system.\n- Emphasis on \u201cbasic\u201d coverage that is timely and efficient; concern about wait times and bureaucratic complexity.\n- Inclusion of preventive care, and in some views, dental and vision.\n- Desire to ensure taxpayers/citizens benefit most; some would limit benefits to citizens.\n- Focus on keeping costs manageable and making sure no one falls through the cracks.</p>\n<p>Reasons for opposition:\n- Skepticism about government efficiency and quality of service; belief that the private sector runs healthcare better.\n- Concerns about high taxpayer costs, potential waste, and crowding out other public services.\n- Desire to reduce dependency on government.</p>\n<p>Implementation ideas mentioned:\n- Expand Medicare or create a basic universal plan, with optional private add-ons.\n- Ensure affordability (some suggested nominal monthly costs), streamlined administration, and timely access.\n- Prioritize preventive services to lower long-term costs and improve outcomes.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
