The markets already seem to sense this.  President Trump's use of tariffs is more of a practice than a policy; although he makes statements about how much revenue is being generated or collected via higher tariffs, the fact is that the US does not have enough manpower to cover all of the ports where imports are off-loaded.   Tariffs feel good to those who see them as simple retribution to those countries who do not maintain a level playing field vis-a-vis trade, but they are a tool, something of a hammer."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 6m 45s "}}

Many express concern that these policies disproportionately affect everyday Americans by raising living costs without creating sufficient domestic job opportunities. Some specifically mention that companies are likely to pass tariff costs to consumers, worsening economic struggles for households.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commentators support the tariffs as beneficial for long-term economic stability. They argue that previous trade imbalances needed correction and that these policies will help reduce national debt while protecting domestic industries.
