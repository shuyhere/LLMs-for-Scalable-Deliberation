Others note the incentive to be outrageous for views, potential misinformation, and a general \u201ccelebrity culture\u201d creep that some find disturbing.</li>\n<li>Expectations/conditions for legitimacy: Many emphasize responsibility, accountability, transparency (especially around advertising), and authenticity. There\u2019s support for holding influencers to professional standards and, in some cases, stronger regulation.</li>\n<li>Context and comparisons: Several link the rise to the pandemic period, compare influencers to 1990s celebrities, and frame the field as an offshoot of the entertainment industry.
