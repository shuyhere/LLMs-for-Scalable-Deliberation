Many feel that tipping requests have spread to inappropriate contexts, with some describing feeling \"bullied\" or pressured into tipping for basic transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is particularly criticized as turning simple purchases into uncomfortable social situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nThe most common suggestion is to ensure workers receive livable base wages rather than relying on tips for income. Multiple respondents emphasize that businesses should take responsibility for paying their employees fairly, removing the burden from customers to supplement inadequate wages through tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Preference for Optional vs. Mandatory Tipping</strong>\nThere's strong opposition to mandatory tipping, with respondents preferring a system where tips are genuinely optional and based on service quality. Many believe tipping should return to its original purpose - rewarding exceptional service rather than subsidizing wages.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Approaches</strong>\nSome creative suggestions emerged, including:\n- Providing tangible rewards to customers who tip (thank you notes, future discounts)\n- Shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping\n- Completely eliminating the tipping system</p>\n<p><strong>Continued Support with Reservations</strong>\nWhile some respondents acknowledge tipping's benefits for workers and express personal commitment to tipping, they still recognize systemic problems with the current model, particularly regarding worker compensation and the psychological pressure on customers.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments suggest a desire for a more equitable system that ensures fair worker compensation without placing undue social or financial pressure on customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
