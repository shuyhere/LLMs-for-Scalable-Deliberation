Some express strong support, arguing that such measures are necessary for public health, collective safety, and achieving herd immunity, especially based on experiences from recent pandemics. They emphasize that protecting the community sometimes requires overriding individual choices for the greater good.</p>\n<p>Others oppose enforcement, particularly of vaccinations, citing concerns over personal freedom, distrust in government transparency or handling of health information, and worries about vaccine safety due to rapid development and potential side effects.
