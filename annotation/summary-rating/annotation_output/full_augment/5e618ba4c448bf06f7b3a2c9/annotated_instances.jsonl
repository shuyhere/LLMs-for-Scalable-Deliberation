Some compare the phenomenon to the <strong>\"Tower of Babel\"</strong>, symbolizing fragmentation and the loss of shared understanding in a world of individual branding.</p>\n<p>There is also <strong>discussion around responsibility and regulation</strong>. Many argue that influencers, due to their reach and influence, should be <strong>held to higher ethical standards</strong>, including <strong>transparency in sponsored content</strong> and <strong>accountability for the impact of their messages</strong>.
