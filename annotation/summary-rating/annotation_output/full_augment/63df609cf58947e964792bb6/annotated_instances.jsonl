A smaller minority (about 15\u201320%) expect positive outcomes, while the rest describe mixed or conditional effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons cited for negative impact:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Higher consumer prices and inflation as businesses pass tariff costs through.</li>\n<li>Strain on small businesses, supply chain disruptions, product delays, and reduced availability.</li>\n<li>Retaliation and deteriorating trade relationships, risking isolation and less free trade.</li>\n<li>Limited reshoring prospects due to eroded supply chains; firms may \u201cwait it out\u201d or route around tariffs.</li>\n<li>Investment uncertainty, reduced output and income, and concerns about recession; middle- and lower-income households seen as bearing the brunt.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perception that job gains are modest or stalled, with price increases already felt.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reasons cited for positive or potentially positive impact:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Protection for domestic industries and encouragement to \u201cbuy American,\u201d potentially boosting competitiveness.</li>\n<li>Increased tariff revenue and leverage in negotiations; some believe it corrects perceived trade imbalances.</li>\n<li>Expectations of long-term benefits after short-term pain; potential budget improvements.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few note minimal current impact due to workarounds, or see benefits for certain investors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mixed/conditional views:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Outcomes depend on targeting, implementation, and complementary policies; poorly designed or unpredictable measures could negate benefits.</li>\n<li>\n<p>One commenter referenced projections suggesting higher federal revenues but lower long-run GDP and wages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Overall takeaway: The discussion skews negative, centered on consumer cost pass-through, small-business strain, and trade tensions.
