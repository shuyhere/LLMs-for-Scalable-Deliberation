A significant percentage of commenters view healthcare as a fundamental human right rather than a luxury, arguing that no one should be denied care due to cost. Many express concern about the current system's high expenses and lack of access, suggesting that a universal approach would be both more equitable and more efficient.</p>\n<p>Several comments reference successful systems in other countries as models the US should consider, noting that these systems demonstrate both feasibility and positive outcomes. There is also a belief that government-provided healthcare would contribute to broader economic and national security benefits by ensuring a healthier workforce.</p>\n<p>While the overwhelming sentiment is supportive, one comment suggests conditional support, preferring that government-provided healthcare not be the only option available. Overall, the comments reflect a desire for systemic change to ensure affordable, accessible healthcare for all.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
