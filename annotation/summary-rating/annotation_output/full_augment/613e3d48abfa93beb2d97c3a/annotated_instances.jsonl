Many emphasize compassion, the right to safety, and the importance of providing opportunities for displaced individuals to rebuild their lives.</p>\n<p>At the same time, several commenters acknowledge the need for careful vetting processes to ensure national security and prevent the entry of individuals with criminal backgrounds.

Concerns about economic strain, overcrowding, and the prioritization of domestic needs are also raised, with some arguing that the U.S. should focus on its own citizens before accepting more refugees.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of commenters oppose accepting more refugees, citing issues such as increased government expenditure, competition for resources, and frustration with current immigration and aid policies.
