The most frequently raised issue is the connection between tipping and low wages. Many argue that businesses should be responsible for paying employees a livable wage, which would eliminate the need for workers to rely on tips for their income. This is seen as a way for employers to shift labor costs onto the customer.</p>\n<p>There is also widespread frustration with \"tipping creep,\" where customers feel pressured to tip for an increasing number of services, including those that involve minimal or no direct service, like takeout orders. Commenters express a desire for tipping to be a truly optional act of gratitude for excellent service, rather than a forced or expected transaction. The use of payment screens that automatically suggest tip amounts is often cited as a source of this pressure.</p>\n<p>Several solutions were proposed. A significant portion of participants advocate for abolishing the current system entirely and adopting a model where higher wages are integrated into the price of goods and services. Other suggestions include replacing discretionary tipping with a transparent, compulsory service charge, or standardizing tips to fixed amounts instead of percentages. Despite the criticism, some acknowledge that tipping is currently necessary to support underpaid workers and continue to tip out of a sense of obligation to the employee, even while disagreeing with the system itself.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
