privacy worries also arise.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repairability and longevity: Difficulty repairing devices and short support windows exacerbate waste and costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perceived benefits</p>\n</li>\n<li>Innovation and competition: A notable minority appreciates rapid progress, better performance, cameras, and features;
