Several cite European-style models, integrating service into prices or adding a modest service charge.</li>\n<li>Optional and merit-based: About 60\u201365% want tipping to be optional and tied to service quality, not mandatory or implied before service is rendered.</li>\n<li>Abolish vs. reform: Roughly 30\u201340% explicitly support abolishing tipping altogether; others prefer reform, such as a compulsory service charge (e.g., 10%) with tips truly optional.</li>\n<li>Point-of-sale concerns: About 30\u201340% criticize POS systems that default to tipping, want clearer \u201cno tip\u201d options, and recommend prompting only after clear service is provided.</li>\n<li>Minority pro-tipping views: About 10\u201320% advocate for stronger tipping norms, higher or standardized tips (including fixed-dollar tips), or even compelled tipping due to low wages.</li>\n<li>Additional ideas: Standardize tipping guidance to prevent manipulation; tip after rating service; consider tax relief on tips; offer small acknowledgments (thank-you notes/coupons) when tips are given.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line: The prevailing preference is to reduce pressure, ensure workers earn a fair wage without relying on tips, and make tipping a genuine, post-service reward for good or exceptional service rather than an obligation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
