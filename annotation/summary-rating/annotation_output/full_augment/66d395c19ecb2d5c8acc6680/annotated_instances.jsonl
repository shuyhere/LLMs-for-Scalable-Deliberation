Many express this as a moral duty, drawing parallels to historical traditions of providing sanctuary and emphasizing compassion for vulnerable populations. However, there is widespread concern about implementation, with numerous voices calling for rigorous vetting processes to ensure security and exclude economic migrants or criminals. A significant portion also emphasizes the need to balance refugee assistance with domestic priorities, expressing worries about economic strain, resource competition, and negative impacts on existing citizens. Some suggest strategic placement in less populated areas to distribute benefits. A small minority opposes acceptance entirely, citing national debt, insufficient domestic welfare, or sovereignty concerns. The consensus leans toward conditional support: accepting genuine refugees with proper safeguards while protecting national interests.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
