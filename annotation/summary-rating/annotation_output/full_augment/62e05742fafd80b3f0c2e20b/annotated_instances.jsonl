Some also use it for entertainment and for reflecting on interpersonal conflicts.\n- Benefits cited include improved efficiency, perceived precision, easier access to information, and reduced effort at work\u2014even among those who previously relied on more traditional methods.\n- Caveats recur: information can be inaccurate or irrelevant, there may be bias in accessible sources, and fact-checking remains necessary.\n- Impact varies: while many feel meaningful improvements, others view AI as a useful but non-transformative, optional tool.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
