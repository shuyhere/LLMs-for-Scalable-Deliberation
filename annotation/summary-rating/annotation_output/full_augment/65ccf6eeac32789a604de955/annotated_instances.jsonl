There is a widespread desire for tipping to be reserved for sit-down restaurants where full service is provided, and for the process to be less intrusive, with a clear and easy \"no tip\" option.</p>\n<p>A central and recurring argument is that the responsibility for paying workers should fall on employers, not customers. A large majority of commentators advocate for the elimination of the sub-minimum \"tipped wage\" and believe all service workers should be guaranteed a base, livable hourly wage. This change is seen as a way to reduce workers' reliance on tips and alleviate the financial pressure and guilt often felt by consumers.</p>\n<p>There is a clear distinction made between voluntary tipping for good service and what is perceived as a mandatory system. Many support the concept of tipping as a genuine reward for exceptional service but oppose it being an expected supplement to a low wage. Suggestions for improvement include replacing tips with a standard service charge integrated into the bill or moving towards a model where higher menu prices cover fair wages, eliminating the need for tipping altogether.</p>\n<p>Finally, while some commentators defend the system as a way for hard-working servers to earn more and as a good incentive, the overwhelming sentiment is that the current culture is problematic. The consensus leans toward a major systemic change where employers pay fair wages, making tipping a truly optional gesture of gratitude rather than a social obligation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
