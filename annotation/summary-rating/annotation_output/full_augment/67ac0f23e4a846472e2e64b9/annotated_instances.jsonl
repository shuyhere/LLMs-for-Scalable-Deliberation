Many express concern that funding cuts will harm not just current students but future generations, potentially causing the US to fall behind globally in education and innovation. Multiple comments emphasize that education represents an investment in the country's future rather than an expense to be minimized.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact on Research and Innovation</strong>\nNumerous participants highlight concerns about the effects on research programs, particularly in critical areas like medical research and scientific advancement. They worry about potential \"brain drain\" as researchers may seek opportunities in countries with better funding, ultimately benefiting America's competitors. The connection between academic research and practical innovations that save lives and money is repeatedly emphasized.</p>\n<p><strong>Access and Opportunity</strong>\nMany comments focus on how funding cuts will affect students who rely on financial aid to attend college. Respondents express concern about reduced social mobility and the creation of additional barriers for those from lower-income backgrounds.
