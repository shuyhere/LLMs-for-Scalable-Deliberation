The potential loss of progress across multiple fields was seen as a long-term strategic disadvantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Political and Ideological Perspectives</strong>\nThe comments revealed a sharp political divide. Critics characterized the cuts as authoritarian tactics aimed at keeping the population less educated and more easily controlled. Conversely, some supporters justified the cuts as necessary to counter what they perceived as leftist indoctrination in academic institutions. A small percentage viewed the cuts as addressing inefficient government spending or misuse of funds by educational institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and Social Implications</strong>\nMany respondents emphasized the economic shortsightedness of the cuts, arguing that strong economies depend on well-educated populations. Concerns were raised about creating skill gaps in the workforce and reducing social mobility.
