There were specific worries about potential misuse of data, including the possibility of information being sold to governments or used for surveillance purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Several respondents highlighted how anonymity protects users from professional or social consequences when expressing certain viewpoints.
