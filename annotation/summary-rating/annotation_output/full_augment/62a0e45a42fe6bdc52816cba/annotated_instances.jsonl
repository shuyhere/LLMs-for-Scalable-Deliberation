The reasons for this opposition centered on individual liberty, respect for different beliefs, and concerns about the safety and rapid development of vaccines. One participant also expressed a practical view that enforcement is futile because people will ultimately disregard it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
