A significant portion of the comments support government enforcement, emphasizing the importance of public health, the prevention of disease spread, and the protection of the greater good. Supporters often reference the recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification for such measures, highlighting the role of vaccination in achieving herd immunity and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a considerable number of comments oppose mandatory vaccination, citing concerns about individual rights, bodily autonomy, and the potential risks or side effects of vaccines. Some argue that vaccines, particularly those developed rapidly during a crisis, may not have sufficient long-term safety data. Others question the effectiveness or necessity of enforcement, suggesting that public education and voluntary compliance may be more appropriate.</p>\n<p>A few commenters express a nuanced position, supporting enforcement only under specific conditions, such as during a severe epidemic or when vaccines have been thoroughly tested and proven effective.
