This support is often rooted in empathy, with participants expressing that offering a safe haven is the right and compassionate thing to do for people, especially innocent families, facing life-threatening situations. Several comments highlight that accepting refugees aligns with the nation's founding ideals as a place of refuge and that it enhances cultural diversity. Some also argue that the U.S. has a particular responsibility to help, especially when its foreign policy may have contributed to the instability causing people to flee.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently conditional. A significant percentage of participants emphasize the critical need for rigorous vetting processes to ensure national security and prevent individuals with criminal backgrounds from entering. Another common condition is the concern over resource management. Many believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid negative impacts on the economy and to ensure that current citizens do not have to compete for essential services.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable portion of commentators oppose accepting more refugees. The primary reason cited is the belief that the country must prioritize its own citizens and address internal problems like debt, poverty, and strained social systems first. These participants feel that the nation currently lacks the capacity to care for more people and that resources are being diverted from Americans in need.</p>\n<p>A smaller group remains conflicted, torn between the moral imperative to help those in peril and the practical concerns about the country's ability to support both newcomers and its existing population. Overall, the comments reveal a central tension between the humanitarian impulse to offer sanctuary and pragmatic concerns about national security, economic capacity, and the well-being of citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
