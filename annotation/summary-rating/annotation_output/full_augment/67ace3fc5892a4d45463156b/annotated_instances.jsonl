Many argue that in a wealthy nation, no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities, or face bankruptcy due to medical expenses.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>: Numerous participants point to other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, expressing frustration that the United States lags behind despite its wealth. Many specifically mention Canada and the UK as models to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and Social Benefits</strong>: Supporters emphasize that universal healthcare would improve public health outcomes through better access to preventive care, reduce medical debt and bankruptcies, and ultimately strengthen the economy by keeping the workforce healthy. Several note that catching diseases early through regular care would be more cost-effective than emergency treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>: Many describe personal struggles with the existing system, including inability to afford insurance, lengthy delays in obtaining coverage, and the burden of medical debt.
