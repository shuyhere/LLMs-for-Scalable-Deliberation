A significant portion of the feedback expresses strong opposition to the decision, with many emphasizing the critical role of education in shaping the future of individuals and the nation. Concerns are frequently raised about the long-term consequences, including reduced opportunities for students, a decline in research and innovation, and a weakening of the country\u2019s global competitiveness.
