Many view healthcare as a fundamental right and a core responsibility of government tied to public safety, wellbeing, and national competitiveness.\n- Key motivations: current system\u2019s high costs, inadequate access, and poor outcomes; belief that markets alone fail to deliver equitable, efficient care; desire to prevent people from suffering or dying due to inability to pay.\n- Perceived benefits: broader access (especially for unemployed and low-income people), lower overall costs through risk pooling and efficiency, improved public health and earlier diagnosis/treatment (including chronic and autoimmune conditions), and alignment with international peers where universal systems function effectively.\n- Policy preferences: support for a basic, government-funded insurance floor that ensures essential services, with some favoring the option to choose or supplement with private coverage; interest in models like Canada\u2019s but with faster access.\n- Framing: healthcare seen as both a human right and a strategic economic/national security issue, ensuring a healthy, competitive workforce.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
