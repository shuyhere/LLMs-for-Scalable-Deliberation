A substantial percentage of respondents express frustration with the expectation to tip for minor or no service, describing the culture as overkill and noting they feel pressured or bullied by the prevalence of tipping prompts.</p>\n<p>A large majority of comments advocate for a fundamental shift where employers pay a living wage, thereby reducing or eliminating workers' reliance on tips. Many suggest this would allow tipping to return to its original purpose: a voluntary gesture of gratitude for exceptional service, rather than a mandatory subsidy for low wages.</p>\n<p>There is notable support for integrating a service charge into the bill to replace tipping, mirroring systems in other countries like those in Europe. Some propose specific changes to the mechanics of tipping, such as moving from a percentage-based model to fixed amounts or establishing clear standards to prevent customer manipulation.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment is that the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with employers, not customers, and that the current system places an unfair burden on both patrons and service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
