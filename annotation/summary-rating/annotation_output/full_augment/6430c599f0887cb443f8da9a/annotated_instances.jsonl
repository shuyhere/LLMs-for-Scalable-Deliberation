Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. This comparison reinforces the view that the American tipping system is unique and potentially problematic.</p>\n<p>The consensus suggests strong dissatisfaction with how tipping culture has evolved, with most preferring either its elimination in favor of fair wages or its return to being a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to inadequate pay.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>The comments reflect a wide range of perspectives on the tipping system, with a strong emphasis on its social, economic, and ethical implications. Many respondents express frustration with the current system, particularly the expectation of tipping for minimal or no service, and the pressure it places on consumers. A significant portion of the feedback centers on the idea that tipping should be voluntary and tied directly to the quality of service, rather than being an assumed or mandatory part of the transaction.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that the tipping system disproportionately shifts the responsibility of fair compensation from employers to consumers. Many argue that service workers should be paid a livable wage, and that tipping should not be a substitute for fair employment practices. Some suggest replacing the tipping system with a fixed service charge, as seen in other countries, to make the process more transparent and less burdensome for both customers and employees.</p>\n<p>While a number of respondents support tipping as a way to reward good service, they also emphasize that it should not be expected in all situations, such as for takeout or self-service. Others criticize the growing intrusion of tipping prompts in digital payment systems, which they view as manipulative and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>A few voices defend the tipping system, particularly when it is used voluntarily and as a means of showing appreciation for exceptional service. However, even among these supporters, there is a common call for better wages and working conditions for service workers, regardless of tipping.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights a desire for a more ethical, transparent, and less coercive approach to tipping. Many believe the system should be reformed or replaced to ensure fair wages for workers and reduce the pressure on consumers to tip in situations where it is not warranted.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
