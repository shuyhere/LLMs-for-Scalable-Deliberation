Around 79% are supportive (about 58% unconditionally and 21% conditionally), about 18% are opposed, and roughly 3% are undecided or neutral.\n- Reasons for support:\n  - Humanitarian and moral duty to protect people facing violence, persecution, and threats to life.\n  - Alignment with national identity and values (nation of immigrants, freedom, human rights) and historical precedents.\n  - Responsibility when conflicts are linked to U.S. or allied policies; desire to model global leadership and solidarity.\n  - Potential benefits: cultural diversity, grateful future citizens, economic contributions, and opportunities for rural revitalization.\n- Common conditions/caveats among supporters:\n  - Rigorous vetting and background checks; exclude criminals and non-refugee (economic) migrants.\n  - Reasonable caps/limits and assurance that citizens\u2019 access to resources, safety, and the economy aren\u2019t harmed.\n  - Proper documentation, tracking, and accountability; consequences for breaking laws.\n  - Integration support (education on laws and norms, language/skills training); fair geographic distribution (including rural resettlement); temporary reception infrastructure; clear pathways to naturalization or eventual return.\n  - International burden-sharing; some call for prioritizing under-supported regions.\n- Reasons for opposition or caution:\n  - Concern over fiscal strain, debt, and competition for limited housing, healthcare, and social services.\n  - Perceived inadequate vetting and an already overwhelmed/abused immigration system; calls to pause intake until fixed.\n  - Preference that refugees seek protection in neighboring countries; worries about public safety and crowding.\n  - Sentiment that the U.S. should prioritize domestic needs before expanding refugee admissions.\n- Notable outliers:\n  - A few advocate open borders or accepting as many refugees as possible.\n  - A few urge halting admissions entirely, citing chaos or crime.\n  - Some express concern about potential mistreatment of refugees after arrival and emphasize humane treatment throughout the process.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
