Many want tipping to be optional and tied to quality of service rather than expected for every transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compensation and policy: Strong support for paying workers a livable base wage so income doesn\u2019t rely on tips. Ideas include ending the tip credit, raising minimum wages (often cited around $15), integrating a modest service charge into bills, or increasing menu prices to fund fair pay. A few suggest not taxing tips.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scope of tipping: Many want tipping largely limited to full-service restaurants and clear, labor-intensive services\u2014not counter service, pickup, drive-thru, or minimal-contact transactions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voluntariness and timing: Tips should be earned and requested only after service is rendered. Mandatory tipping is broadly opposed; service-based discretion is preferred.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Point-of-sale practices: Widespread frustration with intrusive tablet prompts and social pressure. Suggested fixes include less aggressive defaults, an obvious \u201cno tip\u201d option on the first screen, and only presenting tipping when meaningful service was provided.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternative structures: Some propose fixed-dollar tips instead of percentages, standardizing suggested amounts, or providing small acknowledgments (thank-you notes, future-use coupons) when tips are given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divergent views: A minority favors mandatory tipping or universal adoption to ensure worker income; others argue tipping is a strong performance incentive and continue to tip generously.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Core tension: Commenters balance empathy for underpaid workers with fatigue over constant tipping requests. The broad direction favored is shifting responsibility for fair pay to employers and reserving tipping as a voluntary reward for good or exceptional service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
