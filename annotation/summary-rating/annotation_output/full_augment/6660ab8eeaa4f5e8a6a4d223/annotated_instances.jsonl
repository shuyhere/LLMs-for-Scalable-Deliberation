Many commenters argue that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, reduced purchasing power, and increased economic instability, particularly for middle- and lower-income households. Several also highlight the potential for strained international trade relationships and reduced global competitiveness due to the perceived unpredictability and aggressiveness of the policy.</p>\n<p>Some commenters acknowledge possible short-term benefits for certain domestic industries and long-term economic goals, such as job creation and reduced trade deficits, but these views are often tempered by concerns that the negative effects\u2014such as inflation, reduced consumer spending, and uncertainty for businesses\u2014outweigh the positives. A few commenters emphasize that while tariffs may generate additional revenue, they can also discourage investment and lead to retaliatory measures from trade partners.</p>\n<p>A number of responses reference economic studies or projections suggesting that the long-term impact could include reduced GDP, lower wages, and significant financial losses for households. Others point to the complexity of global supply chains, arguing that simply imposing tariffs is unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a smaller portion of the comments express optimism about the policy, particularly in terms of its potential to correct trade imbalances and support domestic industries over time. Some also reference political or ideological support for the policy, though these views are less common and often come with caveats about the need for careful implementation.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward the view that the tariff policy is more likely to have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, especially in the short to medium term, with concerns about rising costs, inflation, and strained international relations being the most frequently cited issues.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
