The majority of arguments center on healthcare being a fundamental human right rather than a luxury, with many expressing that people should not suffer or die due to inability to pay. There is significant concern about the current system's high costs, lack of access, and poor outcomes compared to other countries. Many believe government involvement would make healthcare more affordable, efficient, and equitable for all citizens. Some also frame it as an economic and national security issue, noting that a healthy population is essential for global competitiveness. A small minority supports the concept but expresses hesitation about making it the only option available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
