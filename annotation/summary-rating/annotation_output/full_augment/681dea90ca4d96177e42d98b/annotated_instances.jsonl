These supporters cite moral obligations, noting that refugees don't choose their circumstances and deserve safety and opportunities for better lives. Several invoke the golden rule, imagining themselves in refugees' positions and hoping for compassion. Others reference America's historical identity as a nation founded by those fleeing persecution.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional support</strong> emerges as another major perspective, with many respondents supporting refugee acceptance but emphasizing the need for thorough vetting processes. These comments stress the importance of distinguishing genuine refugees from economic migrants or those with criminal backgrounds. Several suggest that acceptance should come with requirements for integration education and understanding of American society and laws.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource concerns</strong> appear throughout the responses, with supporters and opponents alike discussing the balance between humanitarian aid and domestic priorities. Some argue that America's resources should be shared with those in need, while others contend that the country cannot afford to help refugees when it struggles to support its own citizens. The debate often centers on whether accepting refugees strains social systems or whether America has sufficient abundance to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic and demographic considerations</strong> also factor into the discussion, with some viewing refugees as potential contributors to rural economies and cultural diversity, while others see them as competition for limited resources. Several respondents suggest that refugee acceptance should be contingent on economic impact, supporting it only if it doesn't negatively affect the domestic economy.</p>\n<p>The responses reflect deep tensions between humanitarian impulses and practical concerns about security, resources, and national priorities, with most respondents seeking some form of balanced approach rather than absolute positions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
