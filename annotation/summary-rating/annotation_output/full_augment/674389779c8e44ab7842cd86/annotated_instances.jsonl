I understand from the health care workers prospective that equipment and procedure is expensive, so to maintain quality getting large amounts of money basically fuels them. But at the same time we are talking about a human life, and life is more precious than anything. The overall cost shouldn't be expensive in the first place, so the problem is less the health care worker and insurance and more so, the exuberant cost behind the scenes.
