Key concerns include immediate price increases that burden consumers, as businesses pass tariff costs onto customers. Many worry about damage to international trade relationships, particularly with China, and note that affected countries are already seeking alternative trading partners. Critics argue the policy primarily benefits wealthy individuals while harming small businesses and average Americans already struggling financially. Some view the tariffs as poorly conceived, noting they won't achieve their stated goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. due to the difficulty of rebuilding lost factories and supply chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive Impact Perspectives</strong>: Supporters argue the tariffs will benefit the U.S. economy in the long term. They believe previous trade arrangements were unfair, with other countries paying little or no tariffs while the U.S. accumulated debt. Some express confidence in the business acumen behind the policy and suggest that while initial effects may seem negative, future benefits will emerge. Supporters also hope the tariffs will encourage domestic consumption and help lift Americans out of poverty by protecting domestic jobs and industries.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed and Uncertain Views</strong>: Some respondents acknowledge both potential benefits and drawbacks. They recognize that while certain domestic industries may receive protection, the overall economic impact could include slower growth and increased uncertainty. A few comments suggest the policy's actual impact may be minimal, with companies finding workarounds. Others anticipate short-term difficulties but remain optimistic about long-term outcomes, viewing initial challenges as necessary adjustments toward a stronger economy.</p>\n<p>The diversity of opinions reflects the complex nature of trade policy and its varied effects across different sectors of the economy and society.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
