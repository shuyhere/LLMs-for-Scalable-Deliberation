Many express frustration with the increasing prevalence of tipping in situations where it is not traditionally expected, such as for takeout or self-service. There is a common sentiment that tipping should be tied to the quality of service, with several commenters suggesting that tipping should be voluntary and not used as a substitute for fair wages.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback calls for the elimination of the tipping system altogether, arguing that it places undue pressure on customers and often masks low wages for service workers. Several commenters advocate for a model where service workers are paid a livable wage, aligning with the European approach, where tipping is less common and less expected.</p>\n<p>There is also a call for clearer and more ethical implementation of the system, such as removing mandatory tipping prompts in digital payment systems and ensuring that tipping is not coerced or implied in poor service situations. Some suggest that if tipping is to remain, it should be more structured, with fixed amounts or a standard service charge that is optional.</p>\n<p>While some view tipping as a positive gesture to show appreciation for good service, others see it as a flawed system that has become overly commercialized and burdensome. Overall, the feedback highlights a desire for a more equitable and less coercive approach to compensating service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
