Many argued that government intervention would make healthcare more affordable and equitable while preventing situations where people must choose between medical care and basic necessities.</p>\n<p>Some supporters qualified their endorsement by expressing concerns about implementation, preferring a system that maintains timely care delivery or preserves some choice through a public option alongside private insurance. A minority opposed government-provided healthcare, expressing skepticism about government efficiency and preferring private sector solutions.</p>\n<p>Several comments framed healthcare as both an economic and national security issue, noting that healthy workers are essential for global competitiveness.
