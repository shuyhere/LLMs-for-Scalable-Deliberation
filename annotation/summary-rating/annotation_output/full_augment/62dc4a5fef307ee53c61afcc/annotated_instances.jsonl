A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current system for being overly burdensome, often tied to low wages for service workers. Many argue that the responsibility for fair compensation should fall on employers, not customers, and suggest that tipping should not be mandatory or implied.</p>\n<p>Some commenters advocate for the complete elimination of the tipping system, pointing out that it is not a common practice in many other countries and that it can feel coercive in the United States. Others propose alternatives, such as integrating a standard service charge into the bill or replacing the tipping system with a compulsory percentage that is clearly separate from the customer\u2019s optional gesture of appreciation.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the idea that tipping should be a voluntary act of gratitude rather than an expectation. Several commenters suggest that if tipping is to continue, it should be based on the quality of service and not be tied to low base wages. A few also suggest making tipping more transparent and predictable, such as by shifting from percentage-based tipping to fixed amounts.</p>\n<p>Overall, while there is no consensus on a single solution, there is a shared sentiment that the current tipping system is flawed and in need of reform. Many emphasize the importance of ensuring fair wages for service workers and reducing the pressure on customers to tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
