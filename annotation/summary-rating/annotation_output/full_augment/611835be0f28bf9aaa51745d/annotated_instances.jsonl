Many fear these higher costs will disproportionately affect everyday Americans, particularly the middle class, and could lead to reduced spending and economic strain. There are also apprehensions about damaged international trade relationships, global economic instability, and the policy's potential to push the U.S. toward isolation. Some doubt the effectiveness of tariffs in reshoring industries or creating domestic jobs, viewing the approach as poorly executed.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller group of commenters believes the tariffs will yield positive long-term benefits. Supporters argue that the policy will help stabilize the economy, protect domestic industries, and generate federal revenue. They express confidence in a strategic, business-minded approach that prioritizes national economic interests and aims to reduce trade imbalances. Some acknowledge possible short-term challenges but anticipate overall improvement and economic growth in the future.</p>\n<p>In summary, while a minority sees potential advantages, the prevailing sentiment leans toward negative outcomes, emphasizing consumer costs, economic disruption, and relational trade tensions.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
