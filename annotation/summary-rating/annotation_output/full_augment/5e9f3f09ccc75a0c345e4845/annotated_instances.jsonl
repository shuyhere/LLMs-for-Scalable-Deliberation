Critics frequently mention that costs will be passed to consumers, potentially reducing spending and harming middle-class households. Some also express concern about implementation, describing the approach as poorly strategic or confusing for businesses.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments acknowledges mixed or uncertain outcomes, noting that effects may vary by industry or depend on long-term implementation.
