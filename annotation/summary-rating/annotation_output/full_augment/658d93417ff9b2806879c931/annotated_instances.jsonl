A significant proportion of commenters oppose the requirement, expressing concerns about privacy, safety, and potential misuse of personal data. Many argue that anonymity is essential for protecting vulnerable individuals, such as those facing domestic abuse or political persecution, and fear that real-name policies could lead to increased risks like doxxing, identity theft, or harassment. Others highlight distrust in social media companies or governments to handle personal information responsibly, citing risks of data breaches or unauthorized sales of data.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commenters support real-name registration, emphasizing accountability and safety benefits. They argue that it could reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and harmful behavior by making users more responsible for their online actions.
