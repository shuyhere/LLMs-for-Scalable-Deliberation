Many emphasize that education is a foundational pillar of society and that reducing support for schools and research can harm future generations, limit innovation, and weaken the country's long-term competitiveness.

One commenter acknowledges potential justification for reducing funding due to perceived political biases in academic institutions but also warns that such cuts may stifle independent thinking.
