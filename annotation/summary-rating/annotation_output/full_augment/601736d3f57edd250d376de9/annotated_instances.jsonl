Many feel tipping has shifted from a discretionary reward to an expectation or obligation.\n- Wages and responsibility: Strong consensus that employers\u2014not customers\u2014should ensure livable, predictable wages. Many favor ending the sub\u2011minimum tipped wage and raising base pay (often citing $15/hour or more). A common view is that tips should be a bonus for exceptional service, not a substitute for fair compensation.\n- Scope of tipping: Many want tipping limited to full\u2011service restaurants and delivery, not counter service, pickup, coffee shops, or simple transactions. Others would abolish tipping entirely and fold compensation into menu prices or a standard service charge.\n- Alternatives proposed:\n  - Replace tipping with built\u2011in service charges (often around 10%) or higher listed prices.\n  - Make tipping optional and post\u2011service, tied to service quality.\n  - Standardize expectations (e.g., clearer norms, lower or more appropriate suggested tips, or fixed\u2011amount tips instead of percentages on small bills).\n  - Improve POS design: offer an easy, visible \u201cno tip\u201d option, avoid pre\u2011service prompts, and dial back aggressive tip suggestions.\n  - Additional ideas included tax\u2011free tips, partial employer matching of tips, or small tokens (thank\u2011you notes/coupons) to acknowledge tips.\n- Divergent views: A smaller share defends robust tipping as an incentive, with some routinely tipping 20\u201330% and a few favoring mandatory tips unless a living wage is paid. Conversely, a sizable group wants tipping abolished altogether, calling it unfair, confusing, or a way for companies to offload labor costs onto consumers.\n- Common ground: Regardless of stance on keeping or abolishing tipping, many agree that compensation should be fair and reliable, tipping should never feel forced, and requests should be limited to situations where meaningful service is actually provided.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
