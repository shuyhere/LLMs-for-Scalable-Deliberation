They argue that cuts could harm scientific advancement, including vital areas like cancer research, and may cause talented researchers to leave for other countries, ultimately weakening national competitiveness in both STEM and non-STEM fields.</p>\n<p><strong>Political Perspectives</strong><br />\nThe comments reveal a political divide. While the majority criticize the cuts as \"short-sighted,\" \"foolish,\" or even \"idiotic,\" a small percentage support the reductions, citing concerns about \"marxist and radical left-leaning politics\" in academic institutions.
