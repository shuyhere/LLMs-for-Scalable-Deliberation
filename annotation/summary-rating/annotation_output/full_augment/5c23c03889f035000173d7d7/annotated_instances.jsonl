A majority express support, often grounded in humanitarian principles, the moral obligation to provide safety, and the recognition of the U.S. as a nation built on the ideals of refuge and freedom.

Concerns are raised about the strain on public resources, the impact on current citizens, and the perception that aid is disproportionately given to refugees over domestic needs.
