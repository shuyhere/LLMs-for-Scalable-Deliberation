Many argue that the cost of tariffs is ultimately passed on to American consumers, making everyday goods more expensive and disproportionately affecting those with lower incomes.

Supporters believe that the policy could help correct historical imbalances and provide a foundation for economic growth and stability over time.</p>\n<p>Some perspectives acknowledge <strong>mixed outcomes</strong>, recognizing that while certain sectors may benefit, the broader economy and society could face <strong>trade-offs</strong>, including <strong>inflation</strong>, <strong>reduced consumer purchasing power</strong>, and <strong>global economic tensions</strong>.</p>\n<p>Overall, while a minority sees potential long-term benefits, the prevailing sentiment is that the current tariff policy is <strong>hurting the U.S. economy in the short term</strong>, particularly through <strong>higher costs and economic uncertainty</strong>, with <strong>uncertain or limited long-term gains</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
