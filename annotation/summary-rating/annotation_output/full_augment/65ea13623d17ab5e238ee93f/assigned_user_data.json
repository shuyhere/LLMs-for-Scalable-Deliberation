Many view the constant introduction of new models as a form of planned obsolescence, where older devices are rendered less functional or unsupported, pushing consumers to upgrade unnecessarily. This is often perceived as a strategy to drive sales and maximize profits, with only incremental improvements justifying the high costs of new devices.
