A substantial majority express conditional or full support, emphasizing humanitarian responsibility, moral obligation, and the historical role of the U.S. as a nation of immigrants. Many supporters highlight the importance of rigorous vetting processes, balanced resource allocation, and integration measures to ensure safety and minimize strain on existing systems. A significant portion of conditional supporters stress the need to address domestic issues first or implement stricter immigration controls.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage oppose accepting more refugees, primarily citing concerns over economic strain, resource competition for citizens, and insufficient vetting. Some opponents also question the authenticity of refugee claims or suggest regional solutions instead. Neutral or conflicted voices acknowledge the humanitarian aspect but worry about practical challenges and societal impacts. Across all viewpoints, themes of compassion, security, and practicality recur, illustrating the nuanced and often deeply personal nature of the debate.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
