The primary reason cited was a belief that academic institutions have \"marxist\" or \"nefarious leftist policies,\" making a reduction in their funding a valid response. Others expressed general trust that the administration had good reasons for the decision, even without knowing the specifics.</p>\n<p>A few participants offered more nuanced views, acknowledging the need to cut wasteful spending but cautioning against harming innovation, or suggesting that cuts might force a needed overhaul of the education system.
