Several describe shorter device lifespans, bugs after updates, and reduced support that effectively forces upgrades.\n- Environmental and financial impacts are recurring themes: electronic waste, unnecessary consumption, rising prices, and added costs from changing accessories/chargers. Some also note privacy worries tied to software updates, and supply-chain factors like tariffs complicating costs.\n- Preferences trend toward a slower, more sustainable cadence: longer release intervals (often 2\u20133 years), extended software/security support, better durability and repairability, and greater standardization (e.g., chargers). A few expect the pace to naturally slow as meaningful improvements become harder to achieve.\n- Overall, commenters favor balancing innovation with longevity, quality, transparency about data practices, and the ability to skip upgrades without penalty to usability.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 20, "num_samples_group_b": 10, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary of the comments:\n- Sentiment is mixed but leans critical of the rapid update cycle.
