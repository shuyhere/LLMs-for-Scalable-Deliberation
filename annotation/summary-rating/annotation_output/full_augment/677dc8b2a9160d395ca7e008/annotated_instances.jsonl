Some also cited benefits such as cultural diversity and moral responsibility, especially where conflicts are linked to U.S. foreign policy.\n- Common conditions and safeguards: Strong emphasis on rigorous vetting/background checks and excluding criminals or non\u2011refugee economic migrants; setting limits/quotas; ensuring that arrivals do not diminish citizens\u2019 access to jobs, housing, or public services; providing integration support (civics, rules, and language education); and strategically resettling people (e.g., in rural areas) with job/skills programs or temporary camps to manage capacity.\n- Reasons for opposition: Concerns about fiscal strain, national debt, pressure on social systems and services, urban crowding, and the belief that resources should first address citizens\u2019 needs. A few comments conflated refugee policy with illegal immigration and perceived unfair access to aid.\n- Overall tone: Compassionate but pragmatic\u2014broad willingness to help coupled with a desire for clear limits, careful screening, and policies that protect community resources and public safety.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
