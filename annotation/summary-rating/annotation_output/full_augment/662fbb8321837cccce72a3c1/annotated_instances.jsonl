A significant portion of respondents express frustration with the expectation of tipping, particularly in contexts where minimal or no service is provided, such as counter transactions or pick-up orders. Many feel that the proliferation of digital payment systems has made tipping feel obligatory and intrusive.</p>\n<p>There is strong support for eliminating the current system in favor of employers paying a living wage, reducing reliance on tips for basic income. Some suggest incorporating service charges into prices instead. Tipping is generally viewed as appropriate only for sit-down restaurants or exceptional service, not as a default for all transactions.</p>\n<p>Opinions are divided on whether tipping should be voluntary or mandatory, but there is consensus that it should reflect service quality rather than subsidize low wages. A minority support tipping as a positive incentive or act of appreciation, but most believe fundamental change is needed to ensure fair compensation without customer pressure.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
