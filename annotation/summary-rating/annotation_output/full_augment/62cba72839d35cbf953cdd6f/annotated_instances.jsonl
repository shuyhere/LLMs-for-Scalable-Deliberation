Many believe that companies will pass the cost of the tariffs directly to consumers, making everyday items more expensive and harming Americans who are already struggling financially. Other negative impacts mentioned include damage to international relationships, particularly with China; harm to small businesses; and the belief that the policy is ineffective at bringing jobs back to the U.S. Some also feel the policy primarily benefits the wealthy and tarnishes the country's reputation as a fair trading partner.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who view the policy positively often focus on its potential long-term benefits. They argue that while there may be short-term difficulties, the tariffs will ultimately strengthen the U.S. economy. This perspective includes the belief that the policy corrects unfair trade imbalances, provides necessary revenue, and encourages consumers to buy American-made products. Some supporters express trust in the administration's business expertise and believe it is time to prioritize the economic well-being of American workers.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments see mixed or uncertain effects. These participants note that while tariffs might protect certain domestic industries, they also create economic uncertainty and raise costs for businesses and consumers. One commenter suggested the policy may not have a significant impact at all, as companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
