Many emphasize that individual rights may need to be balanced against the greater good during severe health crises, with some noting that proper public education about disease severity should accompany enforcement.</p>\n<p>Another substantial group opposes mandatory vaccination, citing concerns about insufficient testing, potential side effects, and the principle of bodily autonomy.
