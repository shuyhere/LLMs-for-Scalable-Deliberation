The majority of the comments express a negative outlook, citing increased consumer prices, economic instability, and negative effects on small businesses and everyday Americans. Many argue that the costs of tariffs are passed on to consumers, leading to inflation and reduced purchasing power, particularly for low- and middle-income households. Some also highlight the damage to international trade relationships and the perception of the U.S. as an isolationist or aggressive trading partner.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments view the tariff policy positively, often emphasizing long-term economic benefits such as reduced trade deficits, increased federal revenue, and the potential for job creation and industrial revival. These supporters argue that tariffs are a necessary correction to unfair trade practices and a step toward economic independence.</p>\n<p>A significant number of respondents acknowledge a mixed impact, noting that while certain industries may benefit, the broader economy and society face challenges such as higher prices, trade uncertainty, and reduced global competitiveness. Some also mention that the long-term effects remain uncertain and depend on how the policy is implemented and how other countries respond.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward concern, with a strong emphasis on the short-term economic and social costs of the tariff policy, while long-term benefits are viewed with skepticism or as speculative.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
