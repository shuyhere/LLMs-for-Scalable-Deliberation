These supporters see influencers as a modern source of information, advice, and entertainment, sometimes comparing them to a new, more relatable form of celebrity or media house. They appreciate that it provides a legitimate livelihood for creators, allowing them to pursue their passions with flexibility and earn a good income. Some also believe influencers can be a valuable source for news and information not found in traditional media.</p>\n<p>However, an equally strong set of comments expresses negative views and concerns. A recurring criticism is the perceived lack of authenticity, with some finding influencers to be \"annoying\" and \"fake.\" Another major concern is the oversaturation of the profession, leading to a culture of conformity where creativity is lost. Deeper societal critiques were also raised, with some feeling the profession promotes unrealistic ideas of success, encourages outrageous behavior for views, and fosters a sense of social fragmentation and narcissism, metaphorically described by one participant as a modern \"Tower of Babel.\"</p>\n<p>Bridging these two perspectives, many comments take a more neutral or analytical stance. They acknowledge that influencing is a logical consequence of the social media era and a real profession with a significant role in shaping trends. These comments often emphasize the responsibilities that come with the job, stressing the need for influencers to be authentic, transparent, and aware of their impact on their audience.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
