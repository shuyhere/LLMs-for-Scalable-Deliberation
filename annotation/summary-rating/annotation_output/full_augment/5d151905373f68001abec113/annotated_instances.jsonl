Supporters argue that it can help <strong>combat cyberbullying, misinformation, scams, and impersonation</strong>, particularly in light of the rise in AI-generated content and online harassment. Some also believe it can <strong>enhance safety for minors</strong> and <strong>aid in the identification of predators or scammers</strong>. A few participants noted that while real names should not be publicly displayed, having them on file for verification purposes could be beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposing the Requirement:</strong>\nThe opposing viewpoint is also strong, with many emphasizing the <strong>importance of online anonymity</strong> and <strong>privacy rights</strong>. Critics argue that real-name registration could <strong>expose users to doxxing, harassment, stalking, and identity theft</strong>, especially in cases involving domestic abuse, political dissent, or marginalized communities. Some also expressed <strong>concerns about data misuse</strong> by social media companies, including the <strong>potential for surveillance, profiling, or selling personal information</strong>. Others noted that anonymity allows for <strong>free expression</strong> and <strong>safeguarding personal identities</strong> in a world where online speech can have real-world consequences, such as employment or social repercussions.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral or Conditional Stances:</strong>\nSome participants expressed <strong>conditional support</strong>, suggesting that real-name registration could be appropriate in certain contexts (e.g., for public figures or verified accounts), but not universally required. Others proposed <strong>middle-ground solutions</strong>, such as <strong>verified identities with pseudonyms</strong>, <strong>optional real-name registration</strong>, or <strong>stronger security measures</strong> to protect user data rather than mandating real names.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Concerns:</strong>\n- <strong>Privacy risks</strong> and <strong>data security</strong> were frequently cited as major drawbacks.\n- <strong>Accountability and safety</strong> were the most common benefits mentioned by supporters.\n- <strong>Freedom of expression</strong> and <strong>anonymity as a protective measure</strong> were emphasized by opponents.\n- <strong>Enforcement challenges</strong> and the <strong>ease of identity fraud</strong> were also raised as potential issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>\nThe debate centers on the <strong>trade-off between accountability and privacy</strong>. While many see real-name registration as a tool for improving online safety and reducing harmful behavior, an equally strong contingent views it as a <strong>threat to personal privacy, freedom of expression, and digital security</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
