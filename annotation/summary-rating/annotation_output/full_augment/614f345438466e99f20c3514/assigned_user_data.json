Many argue that the current system forces employees to rely on customer generosity, which is unpredictable and unfair. There is strong support for raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and eliminating the subminimum wage in the U.S.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Social Norms</strong><br />\n   Some commenters express frustration with the overextension of the tipping culture, noting that it is now expected for almost every service, including takeout, drive-thru, and even self-service transactions. This has led to a sense of pressure or obligation, which many find uncomfortable or exploitative.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Form of Appreciation</strong><br />\n   A number of individuals support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be voluntary and based on the quality of the experience. Some even overtip in appreciation for the effort and skill of service workers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technology and Consumer Experience</strong><br />\n   A few comments mention the role of technology in making tipping more intrusive, such as default tipping prompts on point-of-sale systems.
