Many argue that requiring real names could lead to <strong>data misuse</strong> by companies or governments, increase the risk of <strong>harassment or cyberbullying</strong>, and <strong>expose users to real-world consequences</strong>, especially for those in vulnerable situations such as domestic abuse or political dissent.</p>\n<p>Some commenters acknowledge potential <strong>benefits</strong>, such as increased <strong>accountability</strong>, reduced <strong>anonymity-driven misconduct</strong> (e.g., cyberbullying, scams), and <strong>enhanced trust</strong> in online interactions. However, these benefits are often weighed against the <strong>risks of identity exposure</strong>, <strong>surveillance</strong>, and <strong>loss of anonymity</strong>, which many view as essential for free and safe online discourse.</p>\n<p>A few commenters suggest a <strong>middle ground</strong>, supporting real-name verification for moderation purposes while allowing users the option to maintain <strong>pseudo-anonymity</strong> or alternative personas, provided the platform can trace harmful behavior back to real identities if necessary.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward <strong>caution and skepticism</strong> about real-name requirements, with a strong emphasis on protecting <strong>digital privacy</strong> and <strong>individual autonomy</strong> online.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
