Many argue that anonymity is essential for individuals who may face <strong>repercussions for their views</strong>, such as those in marginalized communities, political dissidents, or individuals experiencing <strong>domestic abuse</strong>. Others express distrust in <strong>tech companies</strong>, fearing that real-name data could be misused, sold, or hacked, leading to <strong>identity theft</strong> or <strong>data breaches</strong>.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a portion of the comments support real-name registration, citing <strong>increased accountability</strong> and the potential to <strong>reduce cyberbullying</strong>, <strong>harassment</strong>, and <strong>scams</strong>. Supporters believe that attaching real identities to online behavior encourages <strong>responsible use</strong> of social media and helps <strong>prevent impersonation</strong> and <strong>bot activity</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some express <strong>mixed views</strong>, acknowledging both the <strong>benefits and risks</strong>. They suggest <strong>compromises</strong>, such as allowing <strong>verified identities</strong> without full public disclosure, or making real-name registration <strong>optional</strong> while maintaining <strong>accountability mechanisms</strong> for misuse.</p>\n<p>Overall, the discussion reflects a tension between <strong>individual privacy and online safety</strong>, with no clear consensus but a strong emphasis on <strong>balancing freedom with responsibility</strong>.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
