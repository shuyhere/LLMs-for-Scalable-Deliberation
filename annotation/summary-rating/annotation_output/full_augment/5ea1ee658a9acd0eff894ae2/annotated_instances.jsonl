A central and frequently repeated argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege that should be tied to income or employment status. Many believe it is the government's moral and civic duty to ensure the well-being of its population.</p>\n<p>Supporters often point to the current system's failures, citing prohibitive costs, lack of access, and the risk of financial ruin or bankruptcy from medical debt. They argue that a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes through increased access to preventative care, catching illnesses earlier. Numerous participants compared the United States unfavorably to other developed nations that have universal healthcare, suggesting the U.S. is lagging behind. The economic benefit of a healthier workforce was also noted as a reason for support.</p>\n<p>Among those in favor, some offered specific conditions or preferences. A few advocated for a \"public option\" to exist alongside private insurance to preserve choice. Others stipulated that care must be timely and that the benefit should be limited to citizens.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of participants expressed opposition to the idea. Their primary concerns included the high cost to taxpayers, a belief in government inefficiency, and the fear that a government-run system would lead to a lower quality of care, longer wait times, and reduced choices. Some also argued from an ideological standpoint, stating a desire to reduce dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
