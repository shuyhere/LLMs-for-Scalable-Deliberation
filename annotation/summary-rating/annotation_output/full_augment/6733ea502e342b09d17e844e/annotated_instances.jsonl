Many express that universal access is a core function of government to ensure citizen wellbeing, with numerous comparisons made to systems in other countries that successfully provide care. The high cost and lack of access in the current system are frequently cited as primary motivations for change, with concerns that people are unable to obtain necessary care or face financial ruin. Some specifically advocate for a single-payer or basic insurance model to ensure coverage for all, particularly the poor and unemployed. A minority voice supports a government option but cautions against it being the only choice available. There is a strong belief that a universal system would be more efficient, cost-effective for society, and vital for national economic competitiveness and security.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
