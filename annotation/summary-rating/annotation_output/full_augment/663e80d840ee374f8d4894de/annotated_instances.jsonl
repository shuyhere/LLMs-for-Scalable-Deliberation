Supporters emphasized that healthcare is a fundamental human right and should not be a privilege based on income or employment status. Many argued that the current private healthcare system is inaccessible, overly expensive, and fails to deliver adequate outcomes for many people. They also pointed to the success of healthcare systems in other countries as evidence that government-led healthcare can be effective and efficient. Some highlighted the economic and social benefits, including improved public health, reduced financial burden on individuals, and a more productive workforce. A few suggested a hybrid approach, supporting a public option alongside private insurance to preserve choice.  </p>\n<p>A smaller number of comments expressed reservations or opposition, primarily due to concerns about government inefficiency, the potential for increased bureaucracy, and the belief that the private sector is better suited to deliver quality healthcare. However, even among these, there was some acknowledgment of the need for government to provide basic healthcare services for the most vulnerable populations.  </p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment was largely in favor of government-provided basic health insurance as a necessary and equitable solution to ensure universal access to healthcare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
