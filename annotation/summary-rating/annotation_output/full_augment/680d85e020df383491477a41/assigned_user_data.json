Participants viewed education as a fundamental right that should remain accessible and safe for all.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Societal Consequences</strong>\nMultiple comments highlighted the strategic importance of education as society's foundation. Respondents argued that education underpins all other professions and that undermining educational funding would lead to societal failure. They expressed particular concern about the negative long-term effects on the country's future, emphasizing that today's educational investments shape tomorrow's workforce and innovation capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Innovation Impact</strong>\nSeveral participants stressed the critical connection between academic funding and research outcomes.
