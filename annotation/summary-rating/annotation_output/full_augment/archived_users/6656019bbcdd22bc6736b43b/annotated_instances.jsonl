Many argue that during a severe epidemic, such as the recent pandemic, mandatory measures are necessary to protect the population, especially when vaccines have been scientifically validated and proven effective. Some emphasize the role of the government in ensuring herd immunity and in taking decisive action for the greater good, even if it means limiting individual choice.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable share of the comments oppose government enforcement of these measures. Concerns include individual rights, the safety and long-term effects of vaccines, and distrust in government transparency and decision-making. Some argue that people should have autonomy over their bodies and that vaccines and quarantines should remain voluntary. Others point to the lack of long-term data on certain vaccines, especially those developed rapidly during the pandemic, as a reason to oppose mandatory policies.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of responses express conditional support, suggesting that enforcement should be based on the severity of the epidemic and the proven effectiveness of the vaccines.
