{"id": "triplet_3342_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Here is a summary of the provided comments:</p>\n<p>Overall, there is a strong and widespread dissatisfaction with the current tipping system. The most prevalent viewpoint is that the system allows employers to underpay their staff, unfairly shifting the responsibility of providing a livable wage from the business to the customer. A significant percentage of commentators advocate for abolishing the current tipping culture in favor of a system where employers are required to pay their employees a fair, livable base wage.</p>\n<p>Many feel that tipping has become overly aggressive and is expanding into transactions where it was not previously expected, a phenomenon often referred to as \"tip creep.\" The use of tablet point-of-sale systems is frequently cited as a source of pressure, making it uncomfortable for customers to decline or select a zero-tip option.</p>\n<p>A common theme is that tipping should be a voluntary act of gratitude for excellent or exceptional service, not an obligation for basic or even poor service. Participants expressed frustration with feeling forced to tip regardless of the quality of the experience.</p>\n<p>While the majority opinion is critical, a smaller portion of comments view tipping as a beneficial way to supplement the income of hardworking service employees who may not earn enough. Some individuals make it a point to always tip, recognizing the financial reliance workers have on this income.</p>\n<p>Proposed solutions to improve the system vary, but most center on eliminating the need for tips by ensuring fair pay. Other suggestions include replacing optional tips with a mandatory service charge, changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts, or simply making tipping a truly optional gesture for outstanding service.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Slightly represented \u2014 little relevant content": "2"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Very informative \u2014 most details included": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Somewhat non-neutral \u2014 noticeable tilt": "2"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
