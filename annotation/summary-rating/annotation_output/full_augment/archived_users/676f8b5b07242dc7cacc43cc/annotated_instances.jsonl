Many are skeptical, citing pressure to upgrade, perceived planned obsolescence, rising prices, changing charger standards, and diminishing year\u2011over\u2011year improvements. Several feel manufacturers rush new models instead of perfecting existing ones, leading to shorter device lifespans compared with older tech. Cost factors like tariffs and resource constraints are seen as contributing to higher prices. On the positive side, some appreciate the pace of innovation\u2014especially camera upgrades, performance gains, and timely security updates\u2014and view smartphones as vital tools for instant access to information. A common preference emerges for longer hardware cadences (around 2\u20133 years) with sustained software and security support in between, more durability, and greater compatibility stability. Some expect the cycle to slow naturally as the technology matures and improvements become less noticeable.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Mostly represented \u2014 most info, minor nuance missing": "4"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Very informative \u2014 most details included": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Completely neutral \u2014 fully impartial": "5"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
