Some support is conditional on vaccines being well-tested and proven effective.\n- Reasons for opposition: Preference for personal choice and respect for differing beliefs; skepticism about enforceability (\u201cpeople will do what they want\u201d); concerns about rapid vaccine development and potential side effects; preference for encouragement over mandates.\n- Common ground and nuance: Broad agreement on the goal of reducing disease transmission; several comments favor evidence-based, time-limited, and adaptable policies, balancing public health with individual autonomy.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Partially represented \u2014 main idea but gaps": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Very informative \u2014 most details included": "4"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Fairly neutral \u2014 mostly impartial": "4"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
