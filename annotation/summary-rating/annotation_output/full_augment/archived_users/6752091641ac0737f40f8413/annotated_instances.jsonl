The primary reason cited is the protection of public health and the prevention of widespread disease for the \"greater good.\" Several participants referenced the recent pandemic, arguing that vaccination was crucial for returning to normal life. One view suggested that enforcement is most important during the early, uncertain stages of a health crisis.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of comments opposed these measures. The reasons for this opposition centered on individual liberty, respect for different beliefs, and concerns about the safety and rapid development of vaccines. One participant also expressed a practical view that enforcement is futile because people will ultimately disregard it.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Slightly represented \u2014 little relevant content": "2"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Slightly informative \u2014 few basic points": "2"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Very non-neutral \u2014 strongly one-sided": "1"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
