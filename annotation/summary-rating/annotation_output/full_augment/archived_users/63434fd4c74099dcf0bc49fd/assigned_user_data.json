These supporters emphasize that helping those fleeing life-threatening situations is \"the right thing to do\" and reflects American values of compassion and providing safe haven.

A recurring theme is that America should \"take care of our own\" before helping others, pointing to existing poverty, debt, and struggles faced by current citizens. Opponents worry about strain on social services and systems, with some expressing frustration that refugees might receive aid while American citizens are denied assistance. Others raise concerns about the speed and thoroughness of vetting processes, security risks, and the distance refugees travel to reach the United States rather than seeking refuge in neighboring countries.</p>\n<h6>Conditional Support and Middle Ground</h6>\n<p>A substantial group expresses conditional support, emphasizing the need for thorough vetting, background checks, and limits on refugee numbers. These respondents support helping genuine refugees while excluding those with criminal backgrounds or those who might be economic migrants rather than people fleeing persecution. Many stress the importance of balancing humanitarian obligations with ensuring adequate resources remain available for citizens.
