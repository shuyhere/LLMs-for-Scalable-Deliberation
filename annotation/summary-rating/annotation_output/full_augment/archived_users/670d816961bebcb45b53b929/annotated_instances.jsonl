A notable portion favored conditional or hybrid approaches (~20%), and a few offered balanced pros/cons without a firm stance (~5%).\n- Reasons against requiring real-name registration:\n  - Privacy and anonymity: Seen as a fundamental right that protects free expression and vulnerable groups (e.g., domestic abuse survivors, marginalized communities).\n  - Safety risks: Fear of doxxing, stalking, targeted harassment, and employment or social repercussions (especially for political views).\n  - Data security and misuse: Concerns about hacks, leaks, third\u2011party data sales, and government surveillance or overreach.\n  - Practical and ethical issues: Intrusive ID checks, questionable enforceability, potential for forged information, and increased risk of identity theft.\n  - Personal/professional boundaries: Desire to keep private life separate from employers and broader audiences.\n- Reasons in favor:\n  - Accountability and improved behavior: Anticipated reductions in harassment, cyberbullying, scams, and catfishing.\n  - Credibility: Real names may enhance trust and civil discourse.\n- Conditional/middle-ground ideas:\n  - Platform-led (not government) verification.\n  - Backend identity verification with public pseudonyms; real identity accessed only for serious policy violations or legal matters.\n  - Strong safeguards: minimal data collection, robust security, transparency, and user choice/opt\u2011in.\n- Overall, commenters emphasized a trade-off between accountability and safety/privacy, with greater weight placed on preserving anonymity or using privacy-preserving verification rather than blanket real-name mandates.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
