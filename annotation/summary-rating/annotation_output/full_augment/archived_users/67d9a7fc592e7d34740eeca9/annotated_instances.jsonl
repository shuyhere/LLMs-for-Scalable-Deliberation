{"id": "triplet_3319_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Based on the comments provided, there is a strong consensus that current tipping practices in the United States are problematic, with widespread dissatisfaction regarding the expectation to tip for minimal or no service, particularly in contexts like counter service or pickup orders. Many express that tipping should be reserved for situations where genuine, personalized service is provided, such as at sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>A prevalent theme is the belief that employers should pay a living wage, reducing workers' reliance on tips and shifting the financial responsibility from the consumer to the business. Numerous comments reference systems in place in Europe or Japan, where service charges are included or tipping is less common, as preferable models.</p>\n<p>There is significant criticism of the pressure and discomfort caused by digital point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip during every transaction. Many suggest these systems should be less intrusive and that a \"no tip\" option should be more accessible.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the act of tipping itself are mixed. A minority view it positively as a reward for exceptional service or a way to supplement income, but a larger portion sees it as an obligatory practice that subsidizes low wages. There is a clear desire for tipping to return to being a voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service, rather than a socially mandatory expectation. The overarching sentiment is a call for systemic change to ensure fair worker compensation and to redefine the role of tipping.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Partially represented \u2014 main idea but gaps": "3"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Moderately informative \u2014 some important details": "3"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Fairly neutral \u2014 mostly impartial": "4"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
