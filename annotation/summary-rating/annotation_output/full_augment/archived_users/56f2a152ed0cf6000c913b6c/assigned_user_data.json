These individuals emphasize that vaccination and quarantine are essential tools for preventing disease spread and protecting vulnerable populations. Many reference the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of how lack of compliance can prolong public health crises and disrupt daily life.

The primary concerns center on bodily autonomy and individual freedom of choice. Many cite specific worries about vaccine safety, particularly referencing perceived rushed development during COVID-19 and reported side effects.
