{"id": "triplet_4455_rating", "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary of comments:\n- General stance: Most commenters support some level of government authority during severe epidemics, prioritizing public health and the protection of vulnerable groups. A sizable minority emphasize individual rights and bodily autonomy.\n- Support for enforcement:\n  - Around 55\u201360% favor allowing governments to enforce both vaccination and quarantine, often citing herd immunity, the \u201cgreater good,\u201d faster epidemic control, and lessons from COVID-19.\n  - About 15\u201320% support enforcing quarantine but oppose compulsory vaccination, preferring voluntary vaccination or access rules set by institutions rather than state mandates.\n  - Roughly 20\u201325% oppose government enforcement altogether, citing constitutional limits, bodily autonomy, distrust of government, and concerns about rushed or unsafe vaccines.\n- Common conditions among supporters: Measures should be limited to truly severe outbreaks, time-bound, evidence-driven, and based on vaccines that are proven safe and effective (e.g., FDA-approved). Many call for clear public communication, transparency about risks and benefits, and free, accessible vaccination. Medical exemptions are frequently implied or stated.\n- Enforcement preferences and concerns: Some endorse penalties or restrictions for noncompliance; others favor education and persuasion over coercion. Equity concerns appear (e.g., avoid cost barriers). Several want measures scaled back as more becomes known about a disease.\n- Key themes: Public health vs. civil liberties; trust in government and science; mixed assessments of COVID-era policies and messaging; the need to balance collective safety with personal choice.</p>", "label_annotations": {"To what extent is your perspective represented in this response?": {"Mostly represented \u2014 most info, minor nuance missing": "4"}, "How informative is this summary?": {"Extremely informative \u2014 highly detailed and comprehensive": "5"}, "Do you think this summary presents a neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"Moderately neutral \u2014 mix of neutrality and tilt": "3"}, "Would you approve of this summary being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?
