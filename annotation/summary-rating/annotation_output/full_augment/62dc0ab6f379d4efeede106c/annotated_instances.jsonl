A significant percentage of participants believe that education is the foundation of society and that reducing its funding will undermine long-term competitiveness, hinder innovation, and limit opportunities for students. Specific concerns were raised about the negative impact on critical research, such as in medicine, and the risk of a \"brain drain\" where talented researchers leave the country.
