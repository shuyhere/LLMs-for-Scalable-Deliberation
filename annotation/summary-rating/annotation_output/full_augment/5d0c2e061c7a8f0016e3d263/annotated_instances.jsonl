Many believe healthcare is a fundamental human right that should not depend on income or employment status, and they frequently cite the high cost and lack of access in the current system as primary reasons for their support. A common theme is the comparison to other developed nations that successfully provide universal care, with commenters expressing frustration that the U.S. does not do the same. They argue that a government system would be more equitable, reduce financial burdens on individuals, and lead to better public health outcomes.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of supporters express conditional approval, favoring a government-provided public option that coexists with private insurance, or expressing concern that care must be administered in a timely manner to be effective. A very small minority opposes the idea, citing concerns about government efficiency, a preference for private sector solutions, and a desire to reduce dependency on government programs. Overall, the sentiment strongly leans towards viewing healthcare as a public good that the government has a responsibility to provide.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
