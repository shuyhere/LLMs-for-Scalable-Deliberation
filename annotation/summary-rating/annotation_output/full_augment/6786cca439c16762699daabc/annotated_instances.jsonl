A significant portion of respondents feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, particularly with digital payment systems that prompt for tips in situations where they were not previously expected, such as takeout orders or minimal service transactions.</p>\n<h6>Key Concerns Raised</h6>\n<p><strong>Tipping Expansion and Pressure</strong>: Many participants noted that tipping requests have spread to inappropriate contexts, with some feeling \"bullied\" or pressured into tipping. The prevalence of digital payment terminals that default to tipping options was frequently cited as making it uncomfortable to decline.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage Structure Issues</strong>: A recurring theme throughout the comments is that employers should pay livable wages rather than relying on customers to supplement worker income through tips. Participants recognize that many service workers depend heavily on tips due to low base wages, creating an unfair system for both workers and customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Mandatory vs. Voluntary</strong>: There's widespread agreement that tipping should be voluntary and based on service quality, not an obligation. Several participants mentioned that other countries handle this better by incorporating service costs into prices and paying workers fairly.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and require employers to pay fair, livable wages. Other proposals include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on payment systems</li>\n<li>Implementing a standard service charge (such as 10%) instead of variable tipping</li>\n<li>Restricting tip requests to situations involving actual service</li>\n<li>Returning to a system where tips are genuinely optional rewards for exceptional service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While a minority of participants support tipping as a way to reward good service or help workers earn more, the overwhelming sentiment favors significant reform or elimination of the current tipping system in favor of fair base wages and truly optional gratuity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
