Many view the current system as a way for businesses to underpay employees while shifting the burden to customers. Some propose a middle ground approach, such as implementing a standard service charge (with suggestions ranging from 10% to amounts included in menu prices) similar to practices in other countries like Japan and Europe.</p>\n<h6>Views on When Tipping is Appropriate</h6>\n<p>While there's general agreement that tipping should reward good service, opinions diverge on where it belongs. Most accept tipping in full-service restaurants where servers provide table service, but many object to its expansion into counter service, takeout, and other minimal-service contexts. Several emphasize that tipping should be voluntary and based on service quality, not mandatory or expected.</p>\n<h6>Worker Compensation Concerns</h6>\n<p>A recurring theme is sympathy for service workers who depend on tips due to sub-minimum wages (particularly the $2.13/hour for tipped workers). Many acknowledge this creates financial instability for workers while also burdening customers. The consensus leans toward raising base wages to eliminate workers' dependence on tips, though some appreciate that the current system can allow exceptional servers to earn above minimum wage.</p>\n<h6>Cultural and Practical Considerations</h6>\n<p>Several comments highlight that the United States' tipping culture is unique globally, suggesting the country could learn from other nations' approaches. Practical concerns include the awkwardness of declining to tip on digital screens, confusion about appropriate tip amounts, and the stress of calculating tips. A minority view appreciates tipping as an incentive for good service or as a way to show gratitude.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a desire for significant reform of the tipping system, with most favoring either its elimination or substantial modification to reduce pressure on consumers while ensuring fair compensation for workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <p>Overall summary:\n- Broad frustration with \u201ctipflation\u201d and pressure: Many feel tipping prompts are overused, especially for minimal or no service, and oppose mandatory or implied tipping.\n- Principle for tipping: Strong preference that tips be optional and tied to the quality of service, not an expectation on every transaction.\n- Wages and responsibility: Frequent calls for employers to pay a livable base wage so workers don\u2019t have to rely on tips; tips should be a bonus, not a substitute for fair pay.\n- Divergent ideas: A small share want to eliminate tipping entirely, while a smaller group favors higher, fixed-dollar tips (e.g., standard $20\u2013$30) instead of percentages to better reflect effort on low bills.\n- Incentives and recognition: Some suggest giving something tangible for tips\u2014such as thank-you notes or coupons\u2014to acknowledge generosity.\n- Flexibility and equity: Acknowledgment that people\u2019s finances vary; tipping should allow discretion without guilt or coercion.</p>\n<p>Common suggestions:\n- End mandatory tipping and reduce aggressive or default tip prompts, especially for low- or no-service interactions.\n- Require employers to provide a livable base wage.\n- Keep tipping as a voluntary reward for good service.\n- Consider fixed-dollar tip options and simple, transparent prompts.\n- Offer appreciative gestures (notes/coupons) to recognize tips without making them obligatory.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
