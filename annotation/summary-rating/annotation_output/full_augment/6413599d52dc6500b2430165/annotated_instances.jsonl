Many express that while the frequent updates bring exciting innovations and improved performance, the rapid pace often makes devices feel outdated quickly and creates pressure to upgrade constantly.</p>\n<p>There is a strong perception that manufacturers prioritize rushing new products to market over perfecting existing ones, with some suggesting this is a deliberate strategy to force consumer purchases.

Many believe that waiting longer between major updates would allow for more meaningful technological improvements and result in higher-quality, longer-lasting products that provide a more noticeable difference to consumers. The prevailing opinion is that the current model is ultimately more harmful than beneficial for consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
