Many highlight that tariffs are already causing or will cause price increases for consumers, as businesses pass on the additional costs.

Many respondents emphasize that companies pass tariff costs directly to consumers, resulting in higher prices for everyday goods and essentials. This price inflation is seen as particularly burdensome for middle-class families and small businesses already struggling economically. Several commenters note immediate negative effects on their personal businesses, including shipping delays, order cancellations, and inability to source affordable materials.</p>\n<p>A substantial portion of respondents predict broader economic consequences, including reduced consumer spending, potential recession, job losses, and disruption to global supply chains. The unpredictable nature of the tariff policy is cited as creating business uncertainty that discourages investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Tariffs</strong></p>\n<p>Supporters argue that tariffs will benefit the U.S. economy long-term by generating revenue, protecting domestic industries, and creating a \"fair playing field\" in international trade. Some believe the policy will encourage domestic production and manufacturing, ultimately strengthening American economic independence. Several positive comments express confidence in the administration's business acumen and suggest that short-term difficulties will lead to long-term gains.</p>\n<p><strong>International Relations and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Many comments express concern about deteriorating relationships with trading partners, particularly Canada and China. Respondents worry about retaliatory tariffs, isolation from global trade, and damage to America's reputation as a reliable trading partner. Some note that affected countries are already seeking alternative trade arrangements excluding the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>Time Horizon Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>A recurring theme distinguishes between short-term and long-term effects. Even some who anticipate eventual benefits acknowledge immediate negative impacts. Conversely, critics argue that promised long-term benefits may never materialize due to the difficulty of rebuilding domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Sentiment</strong></p>\n<p>The majority of comments express negative views about the tariff policy's impact, citing immediate price increases, business disruptions, and concerns about economic stability. While a minority strongly supports the policy as necessary for American economic interests, the prevailing sentiment reflects significant worry about both immediate hardships and long-term economic consequences.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
