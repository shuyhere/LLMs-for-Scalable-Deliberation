Supporters appreciate that influencers democratize celebrity status and provide opportunities for ordinary people to build careers from their creativity and passions. They value influencers as sources of entertainment, information, and authentic connections that traditional media often lacks. Several comments highlight the entrepreneurial aspect, noting that content creation requires genuine skill, effort, and business acumen.

They recognize the legitimate work involved while expressing concerns about responsibility, transparency, and sustainability.
