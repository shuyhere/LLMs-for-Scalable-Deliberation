Many feel that anonymity is an important freedom and that requiring real names could lead to unwanted exposure, harassment, stalking, or even real-world consequences like job loss or violence. Some specifically mention risks for marginalized groups, such as victims of domestic abuse or those with unpopular political views. Additionally, there is apprehension about tech companies collecting, selling, or misusing personal data, or governments potentially exploiting this information for surveillance or arrests.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a notable percentage of commentators support real-name registration, arguing that it would increase accountability and reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, and harassment. Proponents believe that attaching real identities to online actions would encourage more responsible behavior and enhance credibility. Some also suggest it could help prevent identity theft and impersonation.</p>\n<p>A minority express mixed or conditional views. Some support the idea only if implemented by platforms rather than governments, or suggest a compromise where real identities are verified but not publicly displayed\u2014such as through verification badges\u2014while allowing pseudonyms. Others acknowledge both benefits and drawbacks, recognizing the potential for reduced toxicity but weighing it against privacy risks and data security concerns, especially in the event of hacking.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation highlights a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the need to protect privacy, safety, and freedom of expression.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
