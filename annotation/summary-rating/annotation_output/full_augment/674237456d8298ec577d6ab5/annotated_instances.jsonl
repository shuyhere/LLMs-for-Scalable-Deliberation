A few endorsed strong penalties for non-compliance.</li>\n<li>Conditional support: 12% supported enforcement only under conditions such as a truly severe epidemic, vaccines being proven safe and effective, measures being time-limited, strong public communication, and/or vaccines being free to avoid inequity.</li>\n<li>Support quarantine but not vaccine mandates: 20% accepted government-enforced quarantine in severe situations but opposed mandatory vaccination, emphasizing bodily autonomy and the perceived rapid development of vaccines.</li>\n<li>Opposition to enforcement: 18% opposed government power to enforce these measures, pointing to individual rights, distrust in government competence or transparency, and concerns about vaccine safety; some expressed strong ideological objections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Common themes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public health vs. individual liberty: The central tension was collective protection and the \u201cgreater good\u201d versus bodily autonomy and personal choice.</li>\n<li>Trust and transparency: Support was stronger when commenters perceived clear evidence, transparent communication, and competent execution; skepticism grew with perceived mixed messaging or rushed decisions.</li>\n<li>Time-bounded and evidence-based measures: Even among supporters, many wanted enforcement tied to disease severity, robust data, and removal of measures once risks declined.</li>\n<li>Implementation details: Some called for education and sensitization campaigns, equitable access (including free vaccines), and careful use of penalties to encourage compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall takeaway</p>\n<p>Most commenters either supported enforcement or were open to it under clear, evidence-based and time-limited conditions, while a substantial minority opposed mandates\u2014especially for vaccination\u2014on rights, trust, and safety grounds.
