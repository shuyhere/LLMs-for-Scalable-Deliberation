Respondents expressed difficulty distinguishing between real and AI-generated images, art, and text, leading to a general sense of untrustworthiness. Some also view AI-generated content as a form of \"theft.\"\n*   <strong>Over-dependence and Loss of Skills:</strong> Some worry about becoming too reliant on AI for simple tasks, which they feel could diminish their own critical thinking skills and originality.</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral or Limited Impact</strong></p>\n<p>A segment of respondents stated that AI has not yet changed their lives in any significant way. They view it as an optional tool they use infrequently, as a form of entertainment, or as something they have not yet integrated into their daily routines.
