Many note that establishments that traditionally didn't request tips now do so through point-of-sale systems, creating uncomfortable situations where customers feel pressured to tip even for minimal or no service. Several participants specifically mention the awkwardness of tablet-based payment systems that default to high tip percentages and make it difficult to decline.</p>\n<h3>Wage and Employment Issues</h3>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and wages. Many participants believe the fundamental problem is that service workers aren't paid livable wages, forcing them to depend on tips for survival. This creates an unfair burden on both workers and customers, with the tipping system essentially allowing employers to underpay their staff.</p>\n<h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate tipping entirely and ensure all workers receive fair, livable wages. Some propose integrating service charges directly into bills, similar to European models. Others suggest making tipping truly optional and based solely on exceptional service, rather than an expected obligation.</p>\n<p>A few participants offered creative alternatives, such as providing customers with thank-you notes or coupons in exchange for tips, or establishing standardized tipping amounts rather than percentages.</p>\n<h3>Varying Perspectives</h3>\n<p>While the majority favor reforming or eliminating the current system, some participants maintain traditional views on tipping. A small percentage always tip generously and see it as a way to show appreciation for service. Others believe tipping should remain but only when service quality warrants it.</p>\n<p>Several comments emphasize that good service should be rewarded while poor service shouldn't be automatically compensated through obligatory tipping.
