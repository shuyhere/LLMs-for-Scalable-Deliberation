Many see the current system as a way for businesses to underpay their staff, forcing workers to rely on the generosity of patrons to earn a sufficient income.</p>\n<p>There is a significant frustration with \"tip creep,\" where tipping is now expected for minimal or even zero-service transactions, such as picking up takeout. The pressure to tip, often prompted by payment screens, is a common point of contention.</p>\n<p>When discussing improvements, the most frequently suggested solution is to abolish the current tipping system and mandate that employers pay a livable wage. This would make tipping a truly optional reward for exceptional service rather than an obligation. Other proposed changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replacing optional tipping with a mandatory service charge integrated into the bill.</li>\n<li>Shifting from percentage-based tips to standardized fixed amounts.</li>\n<li>Ensuring that tipping is clearly understood as a voluntary act of gratitude, free from any pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some acknowledge that tipping is beneficial for workers who currently rely on it, the consensus is that the system is fundamentally flawed and places an unfair burden on the consumer.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
