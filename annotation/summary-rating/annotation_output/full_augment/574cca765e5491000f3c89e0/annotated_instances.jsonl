Many feel it is a moral duty to help those in life-threatening situations, expressing that everyone deserves kindness and a safe place to live. Some view it as a core American value, citing the nation's history as a refuge for the persecuted. Others believe the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees, especially when its foreign policy may have contributed to the conflicts they are fleeing. A few also pointed to potential benefits, such as increased cultural diversity and the revitalization of less populated areas.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently conditional. The most common requirement mentioned is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure that individuals with criminal backgrounds or who pose a security risk are not admitted. Many supporters also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid a negative impact on the economy and prevent a strain on resources for current citizens. The need for a balanced approach that helps refugees without harming the quality of life for Americans was a recurring theme.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters oppose accepting more refugees. Their main arguments center on prioritizing domestic issues, stating that the U.S. should solve its own problems, such as national debt and poverty, before taking on more responsibility. They express concern that accepting more refugees strains social systems and diverts resources from American citizens. Some also suggested that refugees should seek asylum in countries geographically closer to their own.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
