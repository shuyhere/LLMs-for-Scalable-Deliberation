The most frequently proposed solution is for businesses to pay all employees a fair, livable wage, which would make tipping a truly optional and voluntary gesture of gratitude for exceptional service, rather than an obligation. Some suggest adopting systems used in other countries, such as integrating a mandatory service charge into the bill or raising menu prices to cover higher wages.</p>\n<p>Many participants express annoyance with the expansion of tipping requests to transactions that involve minimal or no service, such as picking up takeout or buying a coffee. The prevalence of tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip is a common source of irritation, creating social pressure and discomfort.</p>\n<p>While the negative sentiment is strong, there is also a consistent belief that tipping should be directly tied to the quality of service received. Several people state they are happy to tip well for excellent service but object to the expectation of tipping for poor or non-existent service. A smaller portion of comments express positive views on tipping, seeing it as a beneficial incentive for workers, a way to help those who are underpaid, or a good deed to show appreciation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
