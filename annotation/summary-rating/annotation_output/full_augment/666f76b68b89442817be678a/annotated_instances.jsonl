Supporters argue that the current market-based system fails to deliver equitable, affordable, or effective healthcare, leaving many without access and resulting in poor health outcomes. Many highlight the success of other countries with government-run systems and suggest that universal healthcare would be more cost-effective and efficient. Some emphasize the moral and ethical obligation of the government to ensure the well-being of its citizens, while others connect access to healthcare with broader societal benefits such as economic competitiveness and national security. A few comments also note the importance of maintaining choice, suggesting that government-provided healthcare should coexist with other options rather than being the only one available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
