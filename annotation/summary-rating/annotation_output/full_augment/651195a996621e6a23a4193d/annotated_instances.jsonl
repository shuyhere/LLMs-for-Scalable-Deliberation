Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. This comparison reinforces the view that the American tipping system is unique and potentially problematic.</p>\n<p>The consensus suggests strong dissatisfaction with how tipping culture has evolved, with most preferring either its elimination in favor of fair wages or its return to being a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to inadequate pay.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                    <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                    <div style=\"max-height: 800px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                        <h5>Summary of Comments on Tipping</h5>\n<p>The responses reveal deeply divided opinions about tipping, with most participants expressing frustration with the current system while acknowledging the financial needs of service workers.</p>\n<h6>Opposition to Current Tipping Practices</h6>\n<p>A significant majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with how tipping has evolved. Common complaints include the expansion of tipping requests to establishments that traditionally didn't ask for tips, such as counter service, pickup orders, and basic transactions. Many feel that point-of-sale systems with preset tip options create uncomfortable pressure to tip even when minimal or no service is provided. Respondents frequently described feeling \"bullied,\" \"forced,\" or \"manipulated\" into tipping.</p>\n<h6>Support for Fair Wages Over Tips</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improvement was eliminating or reducing reliance on tipping by requiring employers to pay living wages. Many participants view the current system as a way for businesses to shift their responsibility for fair compensation onto customers. Several respondents noted that only the United States has this extensive tipping culture and suggested adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included or workers receive adequate base pay.</p>\n<h6>Conditional Support for Tipping</h6>\n<p>While most respondents tip regularly, many believe it should be reserved for exceptional service rather than expected for every transaction. About a quarter of participants support tipping when it rewards good service at full-service restaurants or for delivery, but oppose expanding it to counter service or automated transactions. Some respondents who worked for tips themselves still advocate for system reform.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Appropriate Tipping Scenarios</h6>\n<p>Participants generally agree that tipping is most appropriate for:\n- Full-service restaurant servers\n- Food delivery drivers\n- Services involving direct, personalized attention</p>\n<p>They typically oppose tipping for:\n- Counter service or pickup orders\n- Pre-packaged items\n- Fast food establishments\n- Situations where no actual service is provided</p>\n<h6>Suggested Improvements</h6>\n<p>Common proposals include:\n- Establishing living wages for all workers (most frequent suggestion)\n- Making tipping truly optional without pressure\n- Implementing flat service charges instead of variable tips\n- Limiting tip requests to traditional service roles\n- Improving point-of-sale interfaces to make declining tips easier\n- Creating clearer guidelines about when tipping is appropriate</p>\n<p>A minority of respondents support the current system, viewing tips as motivation for good service or a way to help underpaid workers. However, even among supporters, there's recognition that the system has expanded beyond its original intent.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
