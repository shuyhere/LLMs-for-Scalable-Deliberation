Participants frequently mentioned feeling pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping, particularly with the prevalence of digital payment systems that automatically prompt for tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Wages and employer responsibility</strong>: A significant portion of comments focused on the relationship between tipping and wages. Multiple participants argued that employers should pay livable wages rather than relying on tips to supplement worker income. There was strong sentiment that the responsibility for fair compensation should rest with businesses, not customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Preferences for voluntary vs. mandatory tipping</strong>: Respondents generally supported voluntary tipping based on service quality while opposing mandatory or implied gratuities. Many emphasized that tips should reward good service rather than subsidize inadequate wages.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed improvements</strong>: Suggestions for reform varied considerably. Some participants advocated for complete elimination of the tipping system, while others proposed modifications such as:\n- Switching from percentage-based to fixed-amount tips\n- Providing tangible rewards to tippers (thank you notes, coupons)\n- Making tipping explicitly optional and service-based\n- Increasing base wages to reduce worker dependence on tips</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed experiences with current system</strong>: While most comments were critical, some participants acknowledged the benefits for service workers and expressed personal commitment to tipping regularly. However, even these respondents often noted concerns about low base wages and the financial burden on both workers and customers.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect widespread frustration with tipping culture's expansion and a strong preference for systemic changes that would ensure fair worker compensation without placing the burden on customers through quasi-mandatory gratuities.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
