Some suggest that anonymity is crucial for open and honest discourse, particularly on platforms like Reddit.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable share of the comments <strong>support</strong> real-name registration, primarily for <strong>increasing accountability</strong> and <strong>reducing harmful behavior</strong> such as cyberbullying, harassment, and scams. Supporters believe that attaching real identities to online activity encourages more responsible behavior and helps prevent impersonation and fraud.</p>\n<p>There is also a <strong>middle ground</strong>, with several respondents acknowledging both the <strong>benefits and risks</strong> of real-name registration.
