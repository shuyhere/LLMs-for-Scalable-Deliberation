Respondents worry about increased risks of doxxing, stalking, harassment, and identity theft. Several note particular concerns for vulnerable groups including domestic abuse victims, those with minority political views, and individuals in restrictive environments. The fear of real-world consequences - from job loss to physical violence - features prominently in opposition arguments.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Security and Corporate Trust</strong>: Widespread skepticism exists about social media companies' ability to protect personal information. Many express concerns about data breaches, companies selling user information, and the potential for government surveillance. Several respondents specifically mention not trusting platforms like Meta with additional personal data.</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Opponents argue that anonymity enables honest discourse and protects free speech.
