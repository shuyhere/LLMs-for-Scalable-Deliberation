Supporters argue that real-name policies can help curb cyberbullying, misinformation, harassment, and impersonation.

Opponents argue that such policies can expose users to risks such as doxxing, stalking, identity theft, and real-world harm, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as victims of domestic abuse or those in politically sensitive environments.
