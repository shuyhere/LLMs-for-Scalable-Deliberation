Supporters argue that healthcare is a fundamental human right and a necessity, not a privilege, and that the current system disproportionately burdens low-income individuals and families. Many highlight the moral and ethical responsibility of the government to ensure access to healthcare for all, emphasizing that it is a duty to promote the safety, health, and well-being of its population. Some draw comparisons to other developed nations, noting that universal healthcare is both feasible and effective in many parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Common concerns among supporters include the high cost of private insurance, the risk of medical debt and bankruptcy, and the inaccessibility of care for those without insurance. Preventative care is frequently cited as a key benefit of universal healthcare, as it can lead to better long-term health outcomes and reduce the overall burden on the healthcare system. Some also argue that universal healthcare is essential for economic stability and competitiveness, as a healthy workforce is more productive.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of comments express opposition or reservations. Critics often point to concerns about government inefficiency, the potential for increased taxpayer burden, and the fear of reduced quality of care or longer wait times. Some oppose government-run systems in principle, preferring private options and individual choice. A few argue that healthcare should not be extended to non-citizens or that it should be limited to those who contribute through taxes or employment.</p>\n<p>While some comments advocate for a public option alongside private insurance to maintain choice, others call for a complete overhaul of the system, favoring a single-payer or government-run model. A few suggest that affordable, not necessarily free, healthcare should be the goal. Overall, the sentiment is that the current system is broken and in need of reform, with a strong preference for government involvement in ensuring basic healthcare access for all.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
