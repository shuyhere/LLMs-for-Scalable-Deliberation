The primary reasons for this support centered on the protection of public health and the concept of the \"greater good.\" Supporters argued that such measures are the most effective way to prevent the spread of disease, achieve herd immunity, and save lives. Many referenced the recent COVID-19 pandemic as evidence that enforcement is necessary to manage a crisis effectively. Some also noted that government intervention is needed because individuals may make decisions that endanger the wider community.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a significant portion of comments, around 30%, were opposed to granting the government this authority. The most common arguments against enforcement were rooted in principles of individual liberty, bodily autonomy, and the right to choose what enters one's body. Many of these comments voiced strong distrust in the government and cited concerns about the safety and side effects of rapidly developed vaccines, again using the COVID-19 vaccine as a key example. Some felt that such mandates represent government overreach and that the government has lost credibility in its handling of past epidemics.</p>\n<p>About 10% of the comments presented a mixed or conditional viewpoint. A common stance in this group was to support quarantine measures as a temporary tool to stop the spread of a virus but to oppose mandatory vaccinations. This distinction was often made due to concerns about the lack of long-term data for new vaccines. Others gave conditional support, stating that enforcement is acceptable only if the epidemic is truly severe and the vaccines are proven to be safe and effective.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reveal a central tension between the goals of collective public health and the principles of individual freedom, with opinions heavily shaped by personal beliefs and recent experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
