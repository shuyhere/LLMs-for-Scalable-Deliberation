Many argue that during a severe epidemic, such as the recent pandemic, mandatory measures are necessary to protect the population, especially when vaccines have been scientifically validated and proven effective.

Concerns include individual rights, the safety and long-term effects of vaccines, and distrust in government transparency and decision-making.

Others point to the lack of long-term data on certain vaccines, especially those developed rapidly during the pandemic, as a reason to oppose mandatory policies.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of responses express conditional support, suggesting that enforcement should be based on the severity of the epidemic and the proven effectiveness of the vaccines.
