Supporters frequently cite healthcare as a fundamental human right, arguing that no one should be denied care due to an inability to pay. Many comments emphasize that the current private, for-profit system is prohibitively expensive and leads to poor health outcomes, medical debt, and unnecessary suffering. A recurring theme is the comparison to other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, with commenters expressing frustration that the U.S., despite its wealth, does not do the same. Supporters also believe a government system would be more efficient through wider risk pools and would benefit public health through an emphasis on preventative care.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments express opposition or significant reservations. These concerns center on the potential for high costs to taxpayers, a belief that government is inherently inefficient and poorly equipped to run such a system, and fears over increased bureaucracy or loss of individual choice. Among those who support the idea, some add caveats, suggesting a hybrid system with both public and private options or insisting that care must be administered in a timely manner to be effective.</p>\n<p>Overall, the predominant sentiment is that providing basic health insurance is a moral and practical obligation of the government to ensure the well-being and economic security of its citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
