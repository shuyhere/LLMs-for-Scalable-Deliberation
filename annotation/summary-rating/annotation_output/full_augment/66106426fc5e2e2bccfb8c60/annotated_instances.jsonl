Many suggest eliminating or reforming the system to reduce customer pressure, particularly in situations where tipping is not expected or is mandatory. A significant portion of the comments emphasize the need for fair wages for service workers, arguing that tipping should not be a substitute for a livable income. Some propose alternatives, such as offering incentives or recognition for customers who choose to tip. Others advocate for a shift in tipping culture, such as moving from percentage-based to fixed-amount tipping, to encourage more generous contributions. The general sentiment is that tipping should be voluntary, tied to service quality, and not coercive.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
