The central conflict is between the desire for online accountability and the right to privacy and safety.</p>\n<p>Those who support the requirement primarily believe it would foster a safer and more responsible online environment. Key arguments in favor include increased user accountability, which they feel would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and the spread of misinformation. Supporters also see it as an effective way to eliminate bots, combat identity theft, and prevent impersonation, thereby increasing the authenticity and credibility of online interactions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, opponents raise major concerns about privacy, data security, and personal safety. Many view the freedom to be anonymous online as a fundamental right. They express a deep distrust of social media companies, fearing that these platforms would misuse or sell personal data, or that databases containing real identities would be vulnerable to hacks and leaks. Commenters also highlighted the risk of real-world consequences, such as job loss over political opinions, stalking, or increased danger for vulnerable individuals like domestic abuse survivors seeking anonymous support. Some also questioned the policy's effectiveness, suggesting that malicious actors could still find ways to use false identities.</p>\n<p>A number of participants hold a more nuanced view, acknowledging the merits of both sides. Some suggested hybrid models, such as requiring real-name verification on the back end while allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym. Others proposed an optional verification system, where users could earn a badge or checkmark to prove their identity, allowing others to choose who they interact with. These middle-ground perspectives seek to balance the need for accountability with the protection of individual privacy and freedom.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
