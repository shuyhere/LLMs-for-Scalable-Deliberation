A significant portion of the feedback expresses opposition to such a policy, often citing concerns about privacy, safety, and the potential misuse of personal data. Many argue that anonymity is essential for free expression, particularly for individuals in vulnerable situations such as those experiencing domestic abuse or individuals with politically unpopular views.

Some suggest a middle ground, such as allowing users to maintain pseudonyms for public interactions while verifying real identities for internal platform use.</p>\n<p>Several commenters also highlight the importance of context\u2014such as who is enforcing the policy (e.g., the platform versus the government)\u2014as a key factor in determining whether the practice is acceptable.</p>\n<p>Overall, the majority of the comments lean toward opposition or caution, with a strong emphasis on the value of online anonymity and the risks associated with requiring real-name registration.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
