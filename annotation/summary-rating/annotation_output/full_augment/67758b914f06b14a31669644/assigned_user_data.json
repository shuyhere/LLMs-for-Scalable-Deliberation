They argue that the ability to trace accounts to real individuals would aid law enforcement and investigations.</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Perspectives</h6>\n<p>Some participants expressed nuanced views:</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support</strong>: Several suggested that platforms should have real identity information for backend verification while allowing pseudonyms for public display.
