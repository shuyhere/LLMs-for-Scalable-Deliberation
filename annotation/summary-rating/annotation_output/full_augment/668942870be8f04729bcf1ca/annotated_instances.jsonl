Many highlight the U.S.\u2019s historical role as a refuge and the value of compassion and diversity. Supporters often argue that the U.S. has the resources to help and that offering refuge is a moral duty, particularly when U.S. foreign policy may have contributed to the crisis.</p>\n<p>However, a notable share of the comments express concerns about the impact on domestic resources, economic strain, and national security. Some argue that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens and that the current systems are already overburdened. Others emphasize the need for rigorous vetting processes, limits on numbers, and integration support to prevent negative consequences for both refugees and existing residents.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments are neutral or on the fence, acknowledging the moral imperative to help but also expressing uncertainty or concern about implementation. A few voices are strongly opposed, arguing that refugees should seek refuge in neighboring countries or that the U.S. is not the appropriate place for them.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward support for accepting refugees fleeing persecution, but with a strong emphasis on balanced, well-managed policies that ensure safety, fairness, and sustainability.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
