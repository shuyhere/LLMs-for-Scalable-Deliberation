Some express concerns about long-term costs and growth in numbers, as well as perceptions of unfairness or confusion between refugees and unauthorized immigration.\n- Areas of convergence: Broad concern for protecting innocents coexists with a desire for an orderly, well-managed system that balances compassion with capacity, vetting, and community impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
