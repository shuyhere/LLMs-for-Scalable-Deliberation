The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumer goods, as companies pass the additional costs onto customers. Many note that prices have already risen since implementation, affecting everything from everyday essentials to business supplies. Several commenters worry this will reduce consumer spending power and potentially trigger a recession.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects on Business and Trade</strong></p>\n<p>Small businesses appear particularly vulnerable, with multiple business owners reporting direct negative impacts on their operations. Some can no longer afford to import necessary supplies or products for resale. Others observe decreased shipping volumes and reduced international trade activity. Many express concern that the tariffs are damaging America's relationships with trading partners and pushing other countries to seek alternative trade arrangements.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term vs. Short-term Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>While the majority view is negative, approximately one-quarter of respondents see potential positive outcomes. These supporters argue that tariffs could protect domestic industries, encourage \"Buy American\" behavior, and generate revenue for the federal government. Some acknowledge short-term pain but believe long-term benefits will emerge as domestic manufacturing increases and trade imbalances are corrected.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Criticisms</strong></p>\n<p>Critics frequently characterize the tariffs as poorly conceived, noting they appear to be blanket measures rather than strategic, targeted policies. Many question whether the administration fully understands how tariffs function, expressing frustration that American consumers, not foreign countries, ultimately bear the cost. Several describe the policies as unstable and unpredictable, creating uncertainty that discourages business investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Mixed Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>A small portion of respondents express uncertainty or see both positive and negative aspects. These individuals often cite the complexity of global trade and acknowledge that while some industries might benefit, others will suffer. A few admit limited knowledge about tariffs but still express concern based on their observations of rising prices.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect deep skepticism about the tariff policy's effectiveness and widespread worry about its impact on American consumers and the broader economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
