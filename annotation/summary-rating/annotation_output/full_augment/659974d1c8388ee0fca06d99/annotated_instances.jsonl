The primary concerns centered on the negative impact on students, with many stating that such cuts are unfair, limit resources, and particularly harm those who cannot afford higher education.</p>\n<p>Several participants broadened the scope of their concern to the national level, arguing that education is the foundation of society and that reducing its funding would weaken the country\u2019s long-term competitiveness and lead to a \"future of failure.\" The potential loss of innovation from research was a key theme, with some worrying that a reduction in funding would cause a \"brain drain,\" where talented researchers would leave to benefit competitor nations.</p>\n<p>A minority of viewpoints offered more nuance. One perspective saw some justification for cuts due to a perceived political bias in academic institutions but also expressed concern that this could stifle independent thinking. Another comment conveyed trust that there was a larger plan in place but acknowledged the risk of a decline in educational quality without a clear alternative solution. A small portion of respondents felt they lacked sufficient information to form an opinion on the matter.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
