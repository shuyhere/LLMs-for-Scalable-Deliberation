They emphasize that protecting the community sometimes requires overriding individual choices for the greater good.</p>\n<p>Others oppose enforcement, particularly of vaccinations, citing concerns over personal freedom, distrust in government transparency or handling of health information, and worries about vaccine safety due to rapid development and potential side effects. Some suggest that while quarantine might be acceptable in severe situations, vaccination should remain optional.</p>\n<p>A middle ground emerges among some commenters, who conditionally support enforcement only for truly severe epidemics, with effective and well-tested vaccines, and emphasize the need for proper public education and justification of measures.
