A smaller group believes it will be positive\u2014especially over the long term\u2014while a few describe mixed or limited effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main arguments for negative impact:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Higher consumer prices and inflation, with tariffs described as a tax passed on to buyers; reduced purchasing power and lower consumer spending.</li>\n<li>Disproportionate harm to small businesses and import-reliant sectors; reports of delayed/canceled shipments and declining package volumes in logistics.</li>\n<li>Investment uncertainty and volatility, with concerns that blanket tariffs won\u2019t effectively reshore production given lost supply chains and capacity.</li>\n<li>Risk of retaliation, deteriorating trade relations, and damage to U.S. credibility/soft power.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Broader macro risks: potential GDP and wage losses, recession risk, job cuts, and worsening inequality, with particular strain on lower-income households.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main arguments for positive impact:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Potential to protect domestic industries, level the playing field, reduce the trade deficit, raise federal revenue, and encourage \u201cbuy American.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some believe short-term pain could yield long-term gains if it spurs domestic production and better trade terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mixed/conditional views:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Effects may be limited if firms work around tariffs.</li>\n<li>Outcomes depend on implementation\u2014targeted, strategic tariffs are seen as more defensible than blanket measures.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several expect short-term negatives but see possible long-run benefits if paired with capacity building and stable policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lived experiences and observations:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many report already facing higher prices for everyday goods and business inputs.</li>\n<li>Small-business owners and logistics workers cite reduced orders, added import duties, and operational disruptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall takeaway: The prevailing view is that immediate costs\u2014higher prices, business strain, and uncertainty\u2014outweigh uncertain long-term benefits.
