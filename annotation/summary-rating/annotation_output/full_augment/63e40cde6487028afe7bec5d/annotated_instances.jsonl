The comments frame this issue through several key arguments:</p>\n<p>A primary theme is that healthcare should be a fundamental human right, not a luxury commodity. Participants argue that it is a moral imperative and a core responsibility of government to care for its citizens, ensuring that no one suffers or dies because they cannot afford medical help.</p>\n<p>Many comments are highly critical of the current market-based system, describing it as a failure that is inefficient, provides poor access, and is prohibitively expensive for many. They contend that the private market has not been able to deliver good outcomes or serve the social good.</p>\n<p>There is a belief that a government-provided system would be more efficient and affordable. The reasoning is that universal participation would lower overall costs. Several comments point to the successful implementation of such systems in other countries as evidence that this model is viable and effective.</p>\n<p>The benefits are also seen in economic and national security terms. It is argued that a healthy workforce is necessary for the country to remain competitive in the global economy.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some nuance is present. One perspective favors a government-provided option as long as it does not become the <em>only</em> choice available. Another suggests modeling a new system on an existing one, like Canada's, but with improvements to ensure faster service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
