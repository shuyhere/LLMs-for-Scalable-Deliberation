They also stress the importance of integration efforts, such as education on societal norms.</p>\n<p>Conversely, some express opposition or hesitation, primarily due to concerns about economic strain, resource allocation, and the potential negative impact on existing citizens. These comments often argue that domestic issues should be prioritized before accepting more refugees, citing national debt, overcrowding, or insufficient support for current residents.</p>\n<p>A few comments acknowledge the complexity of the issue, noting that geopolitical factors, such as past foreign policies, may create a responsibility to accept refugees.
