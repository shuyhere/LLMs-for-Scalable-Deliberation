Supporters emphasized the importance of <strong>public health, herd immunity, and the protection of vulnerable populations</strong>. Many referenced the <strong>experience of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong> as a justification for such measures, noting how vaccines and quarantines helped curb the spread of the virus and save lives. Others argued that in times of crisis, <strong>collective action and government intervention are necessary</strong> to ensure safety and prevent widespread harm.</p>\n<p>Some respondents supported <strong>quarantine measures but opposed mandatory vaccination</strong>, often citing concerns about <strong>bodily autonomy, vaccine safety, and the rapid development of vaccines</strong> during the pandemic. Others expressed <strong>skepticism about the government\u2019s role</strong>, citing <strong>lack of trust in government transparency, potential for abuse of power, and infringement on individual rights</strong>.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters emphasized the <strong>need for balance</strong>, supporting government intervention <strong>only when the epidemic is severe and vaccines are proven to be safe and effective</strong>. Others suggested that <strong>education and voluntary compliance</strong> should take precedence over enforcement, or that <strong>personal choice and freedom should be preserved</strong>, even if it meant accepting the risks associated with non-compliance.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a <strong>diverse range of perspectives</strong>, with many acknowledging the <strong>complexity of balancing public health, individual rights, and government authority</strong> during public health emergencies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
