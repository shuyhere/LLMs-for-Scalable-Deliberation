They view mandatory registration as an invasion of privacy, expressing fears that tech companies would collect, sell, or misuse personal data, or that governments could use it for surveillance. Several comments highlight safety risks, particularly for vulnerable individuals (such as domestic abuse survivors) and the potential for real-world consequences like job loss due to political expression, stalking, or harassment. The freedom to be anonymous online is also a core value for this group, who believe it is essential for free expression and for practical reasons like separating one's personal and professional life.</p>\n<p>Supporters of the requirement focus on the potential for increased accountability and improved online behavior. They argue that linking posts to real identities would discourage negative actions like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, and catfishing, as people would be more likely to act responsibly without the shield of anonymity. Some also see it as a way to combat identity theft and the creation of fake or impersonator accounts.</p>\n<p>A number of comments present a more nuanced or conditional perspective. Some suggest hybrid solutions, such as requiring real-name verification for the platform's internal records while still allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym. This would enable platforms to take action against malicious behavior without eliminating public anonymity. Others noted the dilemma of balancing the benefits of preventing harmful behavior with the risks of personal information being exposed in data breaches. An alternative suggestion was to have a voluntary verification system to confirm identities, rather than a mandatory one for all users.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
