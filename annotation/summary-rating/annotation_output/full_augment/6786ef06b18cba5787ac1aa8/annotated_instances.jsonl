Many believe this would eliminate the pressure and obligation customers feel. Some commenters suggested alternative models, such as adopting a European system where service is included in higher prices or implementing a mandatory service charge.</p>\n<p>A significant source of frustration is the expansion of tipping requests into areas where it was not previously expected, a phenomenon often referred to as \"tip creep.\" Commenters frequently cited the pressure created by tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip for minimal-service transactions, such as pickup orders, counter service, or drive-thrus. This practice is widely seen as inappropriate and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>While the overall sentiment is negative, there is a common belief that tipping, when it exists, should be a voluntary reward for excellent service, not a mandatory or expected charge. Participants often distinguish between tipping for attentive, full service at a sit-down restaurant, which is generally accepted, and being asked to tip for basic transactions. The amount of a tip, in this view, should directly reflect the quality of the service received.</p>\n<p>Despite the widespread desire for systemic change, many commenters expressed a sense of conflict. They dislike the system but feel obligated to tip generously because they know service workers depend on that income due to low base pay. This highlights a tension between opposing the system and supporting the individual worker within it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
