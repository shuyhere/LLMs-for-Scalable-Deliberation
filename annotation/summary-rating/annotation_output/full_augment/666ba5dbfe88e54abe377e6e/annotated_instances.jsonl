A significant portion of respondents express frustration with what they perceive as an expanding and increasingly mandatory tipping system that has extended beyond traditional service contexts.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Concerns About Current System:</strong></p>\n<p>Many participants feel that tipping has become excessive and coercive. Respondents frequently mention being asked for tips in situations they consider inappropriate, such as basic transactions or self-service scenarios like picking up takeout orders. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as particularly problematic, with several people describing feeling \"bullied\" or pressured into tipping.</p>\n<p><strong>Wage and Employment Issues:</strong></p>\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the comments is the relationship between tipping and worker wages. Multiple respondents recognize that many service workers depend on tips due to receiving below-minimum or non-livable base wages. While sympathetic to workers' needs, most commenters view this as a systemic problem that should be addressed through wage reform rather than customer tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong></p>\n<p>The most common suggestion is to eliminate or significantly reform the tipping system by ensuring all workers receive livable wages from their employers. Several participants reference European models where service charges are included in prices and tipping is genuinely optional. Other suggestions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing standardized service charges (with one specific proposal for a 10% charge)</li>\n<li>Making tipping truly voluntary and based solely on exceptional service</li>\n<li>Shifting from percentage-based to fixed-amount tips</li>\n<li>Creating reciprocal benefits for tippers (such as thank-you notes or future discounts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Diverse Perspectives:</strong></p>\n<p>While the majority favor reducing or eliminating tipping, perspectives vary. Some respondents always tip out of recognition for workers' financial needs, while others resist what they see as an unfair shift of employer responsibilities to customers. A few participants support tipping as a way to reward good service but oppose its mandatory nature.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a strong desire for systemic change that would make tipping a genuine choice for rewarding exceptional service rather than a de facto obligation subsidizing inadequate wages.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
