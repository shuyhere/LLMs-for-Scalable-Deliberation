Concerns were also raised about the policy harming small businesses, damaging international trade relationships, and failing to create a significant number of new jobs. Some feel the tariffs primarily benefit the wealthy rather than the general population.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the policy see it as a positive and necessary step. They argue that it levels the playing field with other countries that were previously paying little to no tariffs, bringing in revenue that helps stabilize the economy and benefit the national budget.
