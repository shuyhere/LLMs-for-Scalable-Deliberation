A portion linked responsibility to U.S. foreign policy impacts abroad.\n- Most supporters favored conditions: rigorous vetting and background checks; clear criteria to distinguish genuine refugees from economic migrants; limits or quotas; safeguards to avoid negative impacts on the economy, public services, and citizens\u2019 quality of life; and investments in integration (civics education, cultural orientation, and dispersal to less crowded areas, including temporary camps and skills training).\n- Roughly 15\u201320% opposed accepting more refugees, citing national debt and resource strain, a \u201ccitizens first\u201d priority, overcrowding and social system pressures, concerns about long-term costs, and the view that refugees should seek safety in neighboring countries. Some expressed frustration about perceived inequities in how aid is allocated.\n- A noticeable minority were ambivalent: they voiced compassion for refugees but insisted on strict vetting, clear qualifications, and ensuring the policy does not harm economic stability or public safety.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
