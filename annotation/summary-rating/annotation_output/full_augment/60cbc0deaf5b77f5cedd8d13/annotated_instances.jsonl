Many respondents believe that companies will pass these additional costs directly to American consumers, resulting in higher prices for everyday goods and contributing to inflation. This price increase is seen as particularly burdensome for middle-class families and those already struggling economically.</p>\n<p>Several respondents also worry about the broader economic implications, including:\n- Potential damage to international trade relationships, particularly with China\n- Risk of economic recession and reduced GDP growth\n- Negative impacts on small businesses\n- Challenges in rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity\n- Overall economic instability and uncertainty</p>\n<h6>Supporting Perspectives</h6>\n<p>About 30% of respondents view the tariff policy positively, arguing that:\n- It will help reduce national debt by generating revenue\n- It protects domestic industries and jobs\n- It encourages consumers to buy American-made products\n- The long-term benefits will outweigh short-term challenges\n- It represents a necessary correction after years of unfavorable trade agreements</p>\n<h6>Mixed and Nuanced Views</h6>\n<p>Some respondents acknowledge both potential benefits and drawbacks, noting that while certain industries might benefit, the overall impact could still be negative. Others express uncertainty about the policy's effectiveness, with some suggesting that companies are finding ways to circumvent the tariffs.</p>\n<h6>Key Themes</h6>\n<p>The discussion reflects broader concerns about economic fairness, international competitiveness, and the balance between protecting domestic interests and maintaining beneficial global trade relationships. There's also a notable divide between those who see tariffs as a tool for economic sovereignty and those who view them as economically counterproductive in an interconnected global economy.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
