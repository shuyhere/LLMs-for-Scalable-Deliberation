Many report using it to streamline work, automate tedious tasks, and save a considerable amount of time. Common examples include compiling information, summarizing long articles, planning events, and improving writing for emails, resumes, and proposals. This increased efficiency is often described as giving people more free time and reducing work-related stress.</p>\n<p>Beyond professional tasks, AI is widely valued as a tool for learning and information gathering. Many find it superior to traditional search engines for getting quick, synthesized answers and learning about complex or technical subjects. For some, it has made information more accessible and has served as a \"free tutor.\"</p>\n<p>A significant portion of comments also highlight AI's role in boosting creativity and personal growth. People use it for generating new ideas, assisting with artistic creation like drawing and photo editing, and even for personal advice and emotional support.</p>\n<p>However, these benefits are balanced by widespread concerns. A notable percentage of individuals expressed a growing mistrust of online content, feeling vigilant and anxious about identifying AI-generated art, text, and media. This has led to a general skepticism about the authenticity of what they see and read. Privacy is another major concern, with many worried about personal data being collected and used without their knowledge.</p>\n<p>Other negative sentiments include fears of future job displacement, a concern about becoming over-reliant on the technology, and the feeling that it could diminish personal skills and originality. A smaller group of people feel that AI has not yet changed their lives in any significant way, viewing it as just another optional tool or a form of entertainment.</p>\n<p>In summary, AI is predominantly seen as a valuable assistant that makes life easier, more productive, and more creative. Yet, its rapid integration into society brings serious concerns about authenticity, privacy, and its long-term societal impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?

Before I used AI, I would spend a long time trying to write papers, find answers, or understand hard stuff. Now, I can ask AI for help and get ideas right away. It helps me with spelling, grammar, and even how to say things better. That makes me feel more confident when I write.\r\n\r\nAI also helps me stay organized. I use it to make lists, set reminders, and plan my day. It's like having a smart helper that doesn't get tired. If I don't understand something, I can ask AI to explain it in simple words, and it does. That's really helpful for school and learning.\r\n\r\nOverall, AI has made school less stressful.
