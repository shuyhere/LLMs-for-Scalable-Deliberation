Supporters believe these measures are the most effective way to prevent the spread of disease, protect the community, and allow society to function normally, citing the recent pandemic as a key example. Some feel that enforcement is necessary to override poor individual decisions that could put the wider population at risk. One commenter added the nuance that such enforcement is especially critical during the early stages of a pandemic when a virus is not yet well understood.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters oppose these mandates. Their opposition is based on principles of individual liberty, personal beliefs, and skepticism about vaccine safety. Concerns were raised that the COVID-19 vaccines were not studied for a sufficient length of time before being mandated, leading to potential health issues. Others believe that enforcement is ultimately futile, as people will inevitably do what they want regardless of the rules.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
