The most common concern was the negative long-term impact on the country's future, with many stating that education is the foundation of society and essential for innovation, economic strength, and global competitiveness. Participants argued that such cuts would lead to a \"brain drain\" of researchers to other countries, stifle scientific and medical advancements, and create future skill gaps in the workforce.</p>\n<p>Many also focused on the direct harm to individuals, particularly students.

Several participants shared personal connections, expressing concern for family members in college or how the cuts have already affected programs they rely on.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme among those opposed was the belief that the cuts were politically motivated.
