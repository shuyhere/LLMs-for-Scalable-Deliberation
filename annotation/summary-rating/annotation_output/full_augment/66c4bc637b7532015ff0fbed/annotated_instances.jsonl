Around four-fifths of comments argue it is short-sighted and harmful, emphasizing that education underpins a skilled workforce, social mobility, and national competitiveness. Common concerns include fewer opportunities for students (especially lower-income learners), diminished quality of teaching and campus safety, loss of research capacity (notably medical and cancer research), slower innovation, and a potential brain drain as researchers move abroad. Several also warn of long-term economic costs, erosion of trust in institutions, and perceive political or authoritarian motives behind targeting universities.</p>\n<p>A small minority support or sympathize with reductions, citing objections to perceived left-leaning or \u201cindoctrinating\u201d campus cultures, the need to curb wasteful spending, or confidence that the administration has sound reasons and alternatives. A few take a balanced view, suggesting targeted efficiencies without undermining core education and research, or express uncertainty pending more details.</p>\n<p>The overall tone is passionate and often alarmed about the future impact on students, research, and the country\u2019s global standing, with some comments using strongly charged political language.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
