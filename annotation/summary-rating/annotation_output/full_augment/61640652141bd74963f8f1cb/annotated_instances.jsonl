Many highlighted the current flaws in the private healthcare system, including high costs, limited access, and poor health outcomes. Supporters argued that government involvement would lead to a healthier population, reduce financial burdens on individuals, and promote social and economic well-being. Several referenced the success of healthcare systems in other countries, such as Canada, as models to follow. Some supported a public option alongside private insurance to maintain choice while ensuring universal access.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments expressed reservations or opposition. These individuals were concerned about government inefficiency, the potential for excessive monitoring, and the belief that the private sector could deliver better quality care. A few supported government involvement in providing only basic healthcare services, rather than a comprehensive system.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leaned heavily toward the idea that the government should play a significant role in ensuring healthcare access for all citizens, with a focus on equity, affordability, and public health.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
