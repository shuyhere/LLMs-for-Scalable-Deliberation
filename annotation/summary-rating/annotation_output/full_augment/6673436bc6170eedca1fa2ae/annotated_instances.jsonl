Many commenters are concerned about increased prices for consumers, stating that tariffs effectively act as a tax passed on through higher costs for goods, which could reduce spending and strain household budgets.

Some also fear damaged international relations and a loss of the U.S.'s standing as a reliable trading partner.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of commenters believe the tariffs could have positive long-term effects, such as protecting domestic industries, encouraging local production, and addressing trade imbalances.
