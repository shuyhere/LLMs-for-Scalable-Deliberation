Many express a willingness to pay higher menu prices if it means tipping is no longer necessary and workers receive a stable income.</p>\n<p>Several key themes emerged from the comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tip Creep and Fatigue:</strong> Participants are frustrated with the expansion of tipping requests to environments where it was not previously expected, such as for counter service, pickup orders, and drive-thrus. The proliferation of digital payment tablets that prompt for tips is a common source of irritation, creating pressure and awkwardness.</li>\n<li><strong>Tipping Should be for Service:</strong> A strong sentiment is that tips should be a voluntary reward for excellent and substantial service, not an obligation for minimal interaction or poor performance. Many feel the connection between service quality and tipping has been lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflicted Feelings:</strong> While disliking the system, many people still tip generously out of a sense of obligation and empathy for underpaid workers. They feel trapped between their opposition to the culture and their desire to support service industry employees who rely on tips to survive.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative Systems:</strong> Some suggested replacing the current tipping model with a mandatory, fixed service charge (e.g., 10%), similar to systems in Europe and Japan, to provide more predictability for both customers and staff. Others suggested making the \"no tip\" option on payment screens more accessible and less awkward to select.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
