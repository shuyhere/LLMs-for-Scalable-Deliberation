Many express concern that these policies disproportionately affect everyday Americans by raising living costs without creating sufficient domestic job opportunities. Some specifically mention that companies are likely to pass tariff costs to consumers, worsening economic struggles for households.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commentators support the tariffs as beneficial for long-term economic stability. They argue that previous trade imbalances needed correction and that these policies will help reduce national debt while protecting domestic industries. Some express confidence that short-term challenges will be outweighed by future benefits to the U.S. economy and workers.</p>\n<p>Several commentators acknowledge potential mixed effects, recognizing that while certain industries might benefit from protection, overall economic growth could be slowed by increased costs and trade uncertainties. The long-term implications remain contested, with disagreement about whether the tariffs will ultimately strengthen or weaken the U.S. economy and global competitive position.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
