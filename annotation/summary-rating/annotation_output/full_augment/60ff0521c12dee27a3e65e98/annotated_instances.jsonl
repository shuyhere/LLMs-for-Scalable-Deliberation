A significant majority argue that universal healthcare would ensure fairness, improve public health outcomes, and reduce financial burdens like medical debt and bankruptcy. Many point to other developed nations with successful universal systems as evidence that this approach is both feasible and beneficial.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express concerns about government efficiency, potential declines in care quality, increased wait times, and the financial impact on taxpayers. Some suggest a hybrid model that maintains private options alongside a public system. Several commenters emphasize that care should be timely and comprehensive, including vision and dental coverage.</p>\n<p>There is recurring frustration about the U.S. being an outlier among developed nations in not providing universal healthcare, with many describing the current system as expensive, inefficient, and morally inadequate.
