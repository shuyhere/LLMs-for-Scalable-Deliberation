Some express strong support, believing tariffs will stabilize the U.S. economy, address trade imbalances, and benefit the country in the long term, even if there are short-term challenges. Others voice significant concerns, arguing that tariffs lead to higher prices, hurt small businesses and consumers, strain international relationships, and primarily benefit the wealthy without creating substantial job growth for most citizens. A small portion of commenters acknowledge both potential positives and negatives but lean toward a cautiously optimistic view, suggesting that if tariffs become normalized, they could have favorable budgetary effects. Overall, opinions are polarized between those who see the policy as a necessary economic strategy and those who view it as harmful and ineffective.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
