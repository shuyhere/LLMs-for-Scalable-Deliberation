Many struggle to afford insurance themselves. They argue that universal healthcare would be more cost-effective overall, create a more efficient system through universal participation, and eliminate the burden of choosing between basic necessities and medical care.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nA significant portion reference other developed nations that successfully provide universal healthcare, expressing frustration that the United States lags behind. Canada is specifically mentioned as a model, though with acknowledgment that improvements in wait times would be needed. Respondents question why other countries can provide this service while America cannot.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Benefits</strong>\nSupporters anticipate improved health outcomes, including better diagnosis and treatment of conditions like autoimmune disorders. They argue universal healthcare would strengthen American competitiveness in the global economy and should be viewed as a national security issue. The current system's inability to provide adequate care, particularly for veterans, is noted as a failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition Perspectives</strong>\nThe minority opposing government healthcare express concerns about quality, efficiency, and expanding government dependency. They argue that nothing is truly free, that government is inefficient at managing programs, and that private sector involvement ensures better quality. Some specifically reference opposition to previous healthcare reforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualified Support</strong>\nSome respondents favor a mixed approach, supporting government-provided basic care alongside private options, emphasizing the importance of choice.
