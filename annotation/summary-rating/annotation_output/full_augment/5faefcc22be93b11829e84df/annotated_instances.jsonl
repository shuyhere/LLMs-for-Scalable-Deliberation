Supporters emphasized the importance of public health, the role of the government in protecting the population, and the need for measures like vaccination to achieve herd immunity and reduce the spread of disease. Many cited the recent pandemic as a justification for such enforcement, highlighting how lack of vaccination and non-compliance with quarantine affected daily life and public safety. Some acknowledged that while individual rights may be infringed, the greater good and national survival during a crisis justify these measures. A few suggested that enforcement should be conditional on the severity of the epidemic and the proven effectiveness of the vaccines.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable share of the comments <strong>opposed</strong> government enforcement, often citing concerns about individual freedom, lack of long-term safety data for vaccines, and mistrust in government actions during the pandemic. Opponents argued that people should have the right to make their own health decisions and that enforcement could lead to unintended consequences, such as public fear or adverse side effects. Some expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of vaccines and quarantine measures, suggesting that the policies may be based on conflicting or incomplete data.</p>\n<p>A smaller subset of comments took a <strong>conditional stance</strong>, supporting enforcement during the early, more dangerous stages of an epidemic but opposing it once more information is available. Others supported quarantine enforcement but not mandatory vaccination, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the comments reflect a <strong>diverse range of perspectives</strong>, with some emphasizing collective responsibility and public health, while others prioritize individual rights and personal choice.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
