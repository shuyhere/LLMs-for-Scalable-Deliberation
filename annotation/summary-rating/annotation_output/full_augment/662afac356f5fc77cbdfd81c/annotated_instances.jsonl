The primary reason cited was the protection of public health and the prevention of widespread disease, often referring to it as a duty for the \"greater good.\" Several participants drew on their experiences from the recent pandemic, arguing that such measures are necessary to allow society to function normally. One supporter offered a nuanced view, stating that enforcement is especially critical during the early, uncertain stages of an outbreak but could be relaxed as more information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those who opposed enforcement did so based on principles of individual liberty and skepticism about the measures themselves. These commenters felt that the government should encourage but not force compliance, respecting different personal beliefs. Concerns were also raised about the safety and rapid development of vaccines, with one comment citing potential side effects. Another argument against enforcement was based on pragmatism, suggesting that such mandates are ineffective because people will ultimately disregard them.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
