Many emphasize that individual rights may need to be balanced against the greater good during severe health crises, with some noting that proper public education about disease severity should accompany enforcement.</p>\n<p>Another substantial group opposes mandatory vaccination, citing concerns about insufficient testing, potential side effects, and the principle of bodily autonomy. These commenters frequently express distrust in rapidly developed vaccines and government handling of such measures. However, some in this group show more acceptance of quarantine enforcement while still rejecting vaccination mandates.</p>\n<p>Several commenters express conditional support, suggesting enforcement should be limited to genuinely severe epidemics and only when vaccines have proven effectiveness. This middle ground acknowledges both public health needs and concerns about government overreach.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
