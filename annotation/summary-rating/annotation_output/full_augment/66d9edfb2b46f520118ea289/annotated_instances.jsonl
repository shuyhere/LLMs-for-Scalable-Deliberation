A significant portion supports such enforcement, emphasizing the importance of public health, the prevention of disease spread, and the protection of vulnerable populations. Supporters often highlight the role of science, the need for herd immunity, and the greater good of the community. Some acknowledge that enforcement should be limited to severe epidemics and only when vaccines are proven safe and effective.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a notable share of the comments oppose mandatory measures, expressing concerns about individual rights, bodily autonomy, and the safety and long-term effects of vaccines. Critics argue that government enforcement can be overreaching, that people should have the choice to make their own health decisions, and that some policies may be based on incomplete or conflicting data. A few commenters also expressed skepticism about government competence and trust in public health responses, particularly in the context of the recent pandemic.</p>\n<p>A moderate viewpoint is also present, where some support quarantine measures but not mandatory vaccination, or believe that enforcement should be conditional based on the severity of the epidemic and the reliability of the vaccines.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
