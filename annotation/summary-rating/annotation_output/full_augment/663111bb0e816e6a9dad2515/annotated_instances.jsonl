A significant majority of commenters express that tipping has become excessive and is increasingly expected in contexts where it previously was not, such as counter service or pickup orders. Many feel pressured or uncomfortable when prompted for tips, especially through digital payment systems that make declining a tip difficult.</p>\n<p>There is strong consensus that employers should pay a living wage, reducing workers' reliance on tips. Commenters frequently suggest that tipping should be reserved for sit-down restaurants or instances where exceptional service is provided, rather than being a default expectation for all transactions. Some propose replacing tipping with a standardized service charge or higher menu prices to ensure fair compensation for workers without placing the burden on customers.</p>\n<p>Opinions are divided on whether tipping should be optional or mandatory when service is provided. While some support tipping as a reward for good service, others believe it should be abolished entirely in favor of higher base wages. A few commenters note that tipping can benefit workers by allowing them to earn more than a minimum wage, but this view is less common.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a desire for systemic change, emphasizing employer responsibility for fair wages and a reduction in the scope and expectation of tipping to only certain service contexts.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
