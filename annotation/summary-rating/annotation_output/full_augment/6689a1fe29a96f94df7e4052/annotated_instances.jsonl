A substantial share express mixed feelings\u2014finding AI useful but raising serious concerns. A smaller portion report little to no personal impact or actively avoid AI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most-cited benefits:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Faster research and information access, including concise summaries and simplified explanations of complex topics.</li>\n<li>Time savings through drafting, editing, organizing, and automating routine tasks (emails, proposals, resumes, policies, social posts, tables, note-taking).</li>\n<li>Learning and tutoring support for schoolwork, math, coding, data tasks, language learning, and skill-building.</li>\n<li>Creative boost for brainstorming, overcoming writer\u2019s block, image editing/design, content ideation, and art generation.</li>\n<li>Personal support such as planning trips/events, recipes and meal plans, personalized recommendations, home automation, and even mental health guidance or conflict perspective-taking.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increased confidence approaching problems and improved quality/clarity of writing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common use cases:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Work productivity (drafting documents, policies, business processes), job hunting (resumes/cover letters), e-commerce tasks (pricing, titles, descriptions), and professional communication.</li>\n<li>Academic help (summaries, explanations), code/data guidance, and study aids.</li>\n<li>Creative and visual tasks (photo enhancement, upscaling/denoising, design mockups, shirt designs, art).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal life organization (trip planning, recipes, health and skincare advice, investing basics, sports analysis, dictation cleanup).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limitations and pain points:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Accuracy issues and hallucinations requiring fact-checking; perceived bias in sources.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inconsistent usefulness depending on task; occasional errors with voice/dictation cleanup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Risks and concerns:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Privacy and data tracking; uncertainty about how data is used or stored.</li>\n<li>Job displacement and fears of becoming obsolete, especially in creative or knowledge roles.</li>\n<li>Dependence on AI reducing critical thinking, originality, and student learning; anxiety about losing personal voice.</li>\n<li>Authenticity and trust: deepfakes, fake images/videos, harder to discern real people/content online; educators struggle to uphold genuineness.</li>\n<li>Ethical objections (e.g., \u201cAI is theft\u201d), environmental impact, and frustration with AI being embedded everywhere.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social media impacts, including increased skepticism and perceived decline in authentic interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Behavioral adaptations:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Many verify AI outputs with other sources and use AI as a supplemental tool rather than a replacement.</li>\n<li>Efforts to maintain and upskill to remain indispensable; some deliberately limit use to avoid dependency.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Heightened vigilance for AI-generated content; a portion actively avoid consuming or producing AI content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Outlook:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Broad optimism about AI as a powerful assistant that will keep improving and expanding possibilities.</li>\n<li>Concurrent calls for stronger transparency, regulation, and safeguards to address privacy, employment, authenticity, and environmental concerns\u2014so benefits can grow without undermining trust or human skills.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
