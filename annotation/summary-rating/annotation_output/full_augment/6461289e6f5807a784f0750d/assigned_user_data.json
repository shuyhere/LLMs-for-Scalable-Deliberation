They point to the mandatory participation aspect as a way to create a more efficient system through broader risk pooling. The high costs and poor outcomes of the current system are cited as evidence that the free market has failed to deliver adequate healthcare.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nMultiple comments reference other countries that have successfully implemented universal healthcare systems.
