Several commenters point to other developed nations with successful universal healthcare systems as models the US should follow.</p>\n<p>A small percentage express opposition, primarily citing concerns about government inefficiency, increased taxpayer burden, and preferring private sector solutions. Some supporters qualify their endorsement by emphasizing the importance of maintaining timely care quality and choice through a public option alongside private alternatives.</p>\n<p>Many commenters express frustration with the current system's high costs and limited access, viewing healthcare as both an economic and moral imperative. The military budget is occasionally mentioned as a misprioritization of resources that could fund healthcare. The sentiment emerges that universal healthcare would strengthen national security and economic competitiveness by maintaining a healthier workforce.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
