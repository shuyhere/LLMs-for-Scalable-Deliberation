Respondents worry about the sustainability of constantly producing new devices and disposing of functional older models.</p>\n<p><strong>Planned Obsolescence</strong>: Multiple participants suspect that companies deliberately design products to fail or become obsolete quickly. They report experiences of phones becoming unusable after software updates or mysteriously failing once payment plans end.
