The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass the increased costs of imported goods onto them.

Small business owners mentioned being personally affected by the inability to afford products and resources from overseas.

Some believe that tariffs will encourage buying American-made goods and help reduce the national deficit over time. A minority also expresses trust in the administration's business-minded approach, suggesting that initial challenges may lead to future gains.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a larger portion of comments anticipate negative consequences, focusing on immediate price increases for consumers, strain on international relations, and adverse effects on small businesses. Many are concerned that tariffs act as a hidden tax, raising the cost of living and potentially leading to reduced consumer spending, economic instability, and job market challenges. Some also worry about increased inflation, isolation from global trade, and uncertainty for businesses.</p>\n<p>A few comments note mixed or uncertain outcomes, recognizing that while certain sectors might benefit, broader economic and social costs could outweigh these gains. Overall, the prevailing sentiment tilts toward concern over negative impacts, particularly regarding affordability and economic stability for everyday Americans.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
