There is significant concern about the current system's high costs, lack of access, and poor outcomes compared to other countries. Many believe government involvement would make healthcare more affordable, efficient, and equitable for all citizens. Some also frame it as an economic and national security issue, noting that a healthy population is essential for global competitiveness.
