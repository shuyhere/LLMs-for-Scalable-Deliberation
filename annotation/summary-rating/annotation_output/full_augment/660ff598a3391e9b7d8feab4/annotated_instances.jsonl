A significant portion of supporters emphasizes the importance of thorough vetting processes to ensure security and proper integration into society. Another common theme is the call for balanced implementation, where refugee acceptance should not negatively impact existing citizens' access to resources or quality of life. Some express concerns about economic strain, national debt, and prioritizing domestic issues, suggesting limits or temporary pauses on acceptance. A small minority opposes refugee intake entirely, primarily citing resource competition and preference for regional solutions. Overall, the prevailing sentiment combines compassion with pragmatic considerations for national capacity and security.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
