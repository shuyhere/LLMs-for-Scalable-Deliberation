These views highlight that rapid cycles drive technological advancement, give users access to better features and performance, and deliver crucial security patches that protect personal data.</p>\n<p>However, a larger portion of feedback centers on substantial criticisms. A prevalent concern is the perception of planned obsolescence, where manufacturers are seen as purposely designing devices to become outdated or malfunction within a short timeframe to force consumers into frequent upgrades.
