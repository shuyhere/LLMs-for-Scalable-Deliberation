Commenters frequently cited empathy, a sense of moral responsibility to protect human rights, and the desire to offer safety to people, especially innocent families, facing life-threatening situations. Some also pointed to potential benefits for the U.S., such as increased cultural diversity and the opportunity to populate and boost the economies of rural areas. One participant noted a particular responsibility when U.S. foreign policy contributes to the crises that refugees are fleeing.</p>\n<p>However, this support is frequently accompanied by significant conditions. The most common requirement mentioned is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to screen applicants. Another major concern is the potential strain on national resources. Several participants stipulated that accepting refugees should not negatively affect the economy or the quality of life for current citizens, and that there should be a balanced approach to ensure citizens and refugees do not have to compete for resources. The idea of placing limits on the number of refugees was also raised.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage of participants opposed accepting more refugees. Their main argument was that the nation should prioritize the needs of its own citizens first, citing national debt and the strain on existing social systems. These commenters expressed concern that accepting more refugees would increase the burden on government expenditures and take resources away from American citizens.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
