Many argue that the costs of tariffs are passed on to consumers, leading to inflation and reduced purchasing power, particularly for low- and middle-income households.

These supporters argue that tariffs are a necessary correction to unfair trade practices and a step toward economic independence.</p>\n<p>A significant number of respondents acknowledge a mixed impact, noting that while certain industries may benefit, the broader economy and society face challenges such as higher prices, trade uncertainty, and reduced global competitiveness.
