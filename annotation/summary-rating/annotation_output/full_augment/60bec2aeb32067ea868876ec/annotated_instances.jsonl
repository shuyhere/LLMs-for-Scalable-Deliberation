They use it to streamline routine tasks, speed up research and summarization, plan events, generate ideas, and fine\u2011tune writing (letters, proposals, tables). It supports learning technical topics, cleans up dictation and grammar, offers personalized recommendations, and even helps with home automation. Several note creative benefits\u2014especially for art\u2014and some mention emotional support (e.g., checking reactions in conflicts) and simple entertainment.</p>\n<p>At the same time, users flag important caveats: information can be inaccurate or irrelevant and requires fact\u2011checking; source selection can feel biased; and there are strong worries about privacy, data misuse, and job displacement. A few report growing mistrust or anxiety about AI\u2019s presence in creative work and the potential capture of personal information. Some see AI as helpful but ultimately optional.</p>\n<p>Net takeaway: AI is delivering meaningful efficiency and learning gains across daily and work tasks, but users want better reliability, transparency, and stronger privacy protections to feel fully confident in its use.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
