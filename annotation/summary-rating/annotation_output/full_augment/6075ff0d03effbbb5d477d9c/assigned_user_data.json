They warn of reduced educational quality, fewer opportunities for both children and adult learners, and disproportionate harm to low-income students. Many foresee negative long-term effects: weakened research output and innovation (including medical advances), diminished global competitiveness, potential brain drain, and erosion of trust in institutions.\n- A smaller share supports or defends the cuts, citing perceived left-leaning or \u201cMarxist\u201d bias in academia and expressing trust that there are justified reasons or solutions. One mixed view accepts limited reductions due to politicization concerns but worries that cuts could chill independent thinking.\n- Several nuanced perspectives call for targeting waste rather than broad reductions, emphasizing the need for balance: fiscal responsibility alongside sustained investment in education and research. Others caution that any cuts should come with viable alternatives to avoid degrading outcomes.\n- The tone is often highly charged. Critics describe the move as short-sighted, authoritarian, or politically motivated (e.g., controlling an undereducated populace), with some linking broader policing and social equity concerns. Supportive voices frame universities as ideological actors warranting correction.\n- A small portion expresses uncertainty or requests more details before forming an opinion.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 20, "num_samples_group_b": 30, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary:\n- Most commenters oppose cutting academic funding, framing education as foundational to a healthy society and economy.
