A significant portion of respondents expressed a desire to abolish or reduce reliance on tipping, advocating instead for employers to pay a living wage so workers aren't dependent on tips. Many suggested integrating service charges into prices or adopting models seen in other regions, like Europe, where tipping is less expected.</p>\n<p>Opinions varied on how tipping should function if retained, with some supporting voluntary tipping for exceptional service and others proposing fixed amounts instead of percentages. There was also mention of providing tangible benefits, like thank-you notes or coupons, to enhance the tipping experience. A minority acknowledged tipping's role in supplementing low wages but emphasized that systemic change is needed. Criticisms focused on the expectation of tips for minimal or no service, and the feeling that tipping has become overexpected and manipulative. In summary, there is a strong push for cultural and structural reforms to make tipping genuinely voluntary and ensure fair wages for service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
