Many respondents emphasize empathy, noting they would want safety if in similar circumstances. Supporters highlight that refugees are innocent people, particularly children and families, who didn't choose their circumstances and deserve kindness and protection. Some argue that America's resources should be used to help those seeking better lives and safety from persecution.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to accepting refugees</strong> primarily focuses on economic concerns and prioritizing American citizens. Several respondents argue that the US cannot afford to help refugees when it has significant debt and struggles to assist its own citizens. There are concerns about strain on government systems and resources, with some feeling that refugees receive aid that is denied to Americans. Resource scarcity and the potential negative impact on citizens' quality of life are recurring themes.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional support</strong> represents a middle ground, with some respondents supporting refugee acceptance but calling for stricter vetting processes, clear limits on numbers, and better integration programs. These comments suggest support for helping refugees while ensuring the process is controlled and doesn't negatively impact American society.</p>\n<p>The discussion reflects broader tensions between humanitarian values and concerns about national resources, with respondents weighing moral obligations against perceived economic and social costs.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
