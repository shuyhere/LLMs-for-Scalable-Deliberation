A recurring and dominant theme is that the system enables employers to pay low wages, unfairly shifting the responsibility of ensuring a livable income for service workers onto the customer. A significant percentage of commentators believe businesses should be required to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, which would make tipping truly optional.</p>\n<p>Many feel that tipping should be a voluntary reward for excellent or \"above and beyond\" service, rather than a mandatory or expected subsidy. There is widespread frustration with the expansion of tipping culture, often called \"tip creep,\" where prompts for tips appear for minimal or no-service transactions, such as takeout orders. Modern tablet point-of-sale systems were frequently criticized for creating social pressure and making it uncomfortable to decline a tip.</p>\n<p>Several solutions were proposed. The most common suggestion was to abolish tipping in favor of higher base wages for employees. Other alternatives included implementing a compulsory service charge, changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts, or simply making the \"no tip\" option more accessible on payment screens.</p>\n<p>While the majority of opinions were critical, a smaller percentage of comments viewed tipping more positively, seeing it as a beneficial way to show appreciation or as a necessary supplement to help underpaid workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
