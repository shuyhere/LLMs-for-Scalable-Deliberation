Most argue that healthcare is a basic right and a core responsibility of government, emphasizing that the private market has failed to ensure affordable access and good outcomes. Supporters believe a public system would improve equity, reduce costs through broader risk pooling, and strengthen national competitiveness and security by keeping the workforce healthy. Many reference successful models in other countries and favor a system that delivers faster, more efficient care.</p>\n<p>Key themes:\n- Moral and civic duty: Healthcare seen as a right; government\u2019s role includes safeguarding citizens\u2019 health.\n- Access and equity: Concern for the uninsured, unemployed, and low-income; belief that no one should forgo care due to cost.\n- Cost and efficiency: View that universal coverage lowers overall costs and improves system efficiency, especially with broad or mandatory participation.\n- Outcomes and public benefits: Expectations of earlier diagnoses (e.g., autoimmune conditions), better health outcomes, and a more competitive workforce.\n- Comparative framing: Other nations\u2019 systems cited as proof of feasibility; interest in a model like Canada\u2019s but faster.\n- Design preferences: Support for universal basic coverage, with some wanting to retain choice by allowing private or supplemental options alongside a public plan.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
