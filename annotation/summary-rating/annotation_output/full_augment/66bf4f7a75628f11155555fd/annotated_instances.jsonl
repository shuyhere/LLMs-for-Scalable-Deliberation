They acknowledge its relevance in today's social media landscape and support those who pursue this career path, recognizing it as a natural evolution of how people work and communicate in the digital age.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
