Common benefits include faster research and summarization, better writing and editing (emails, resumes, proposals), help with planning and organization (events, tables), idea generation and learning technical topics, creative support (art, photo editing), education/homework help, smart\u2011home assistance, and fixes for dictation errors. Several people noted improved professionalism, productivity, and even personal reflection in conflict situations.</p>\n<p>At the same time, notable cautions emerged. Many emphasized the need to fact-check due to occasional inaccuracy and bias in sources. Privacy and data collection are recurring worries\u2014concerns about tracking, personal information exposure, and lack of control over data. Some expressed anxiety about authenticity and trust in creative content, with a few trying to avoid AI altogether on ethical grounds.

Net sentiment is positive but tempered by calls for stronger privacy protections, transparency, clearer labeling of AI-generated content, and improved accuracy and sourcing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
