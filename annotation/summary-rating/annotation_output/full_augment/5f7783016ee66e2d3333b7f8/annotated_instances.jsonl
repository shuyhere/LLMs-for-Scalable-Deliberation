Many argue that the current private, for-profit system fails to provide affordable, accessible, or effective care, leading to poor health outcomes and financial hardship. A recurring theme is the belief that healthcare is a social good and a responsibility of the government to provide for the well-being and safety of its citizens.</p>\n<p>Several commenters point to other countries as successful examples, expressing frustration that the U.S. does not offer similar universal care. Support is often conditional on the system being efficient and providing timely care. A small percentage of comments express opposition, citing concerns about government inefficiency and a preference for private sector quality, though some in this group still support a more limited, basic government provision. There is also a noted preference among some supporters for a system that includes both public and private options, allowing for individual choice.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
