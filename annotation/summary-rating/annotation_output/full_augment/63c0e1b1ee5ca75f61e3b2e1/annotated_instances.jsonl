A majority of the responses emphasize that healthcare is a fundamental human right and should not be a privilege based on income, job status, or social standing. Many argue that the current private healthcare system in the U.S. is inaccessible, unaffordable, and fails to provide equitable outcomes. Commenters often point to the success of universal healthcare systems in other developed nations as a model worth adopting, highlighting the moral, economic, and social benefits of such a system.</p>\n<p>Several contributors express concern about the profit-driven nature of private healthcare, arguing that for-profit corporations may prioritize financial gain over patient well-being. Others highlight the broader societal impact of accessible healthcare, including improved public health, reduced financial burdens, and increased workforce productivity.</p>\n<p>A smaller number of responses express opposition to government-provided healthcare, citing concerns about government inefficiency, lack of choice, and a preference for private sector solutions.
