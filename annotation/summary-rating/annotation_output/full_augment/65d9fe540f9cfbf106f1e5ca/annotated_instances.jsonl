Several comments highlight that anonymity is important for protecting vulnerable groups, such as those with unpopular political views, victims of domestic abuse, or individuals seeking to separate their professional and personal lives. A common sentiment is that the internet should preserve the freedom to be anonymous.</p>\n<p>Supporting comments often emphasize increased accountability, suggesting that real-name registration could reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying, scams, and harassment. Proponents believe that attaching real identities to online actions would encourage more responsible behavior and enhance credibility and safety on platforms.</p>\n<p>Some participants express mixed or conditional views, acknowledging potential benefits like reduced impersonation or bot activity but weighing them against significant privacy and safety risks. Suggestions for compromise include making real-name verification optional, implementing it only for platform back-end purposes, or offering verification badges for those who choose to identify themselves.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the strong value placed on privacy, anonymity, and protection from potential misuse of personal data.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
