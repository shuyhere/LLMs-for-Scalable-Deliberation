Opposing voices emphasize privacy concerns, arguing that anonymity protects individuals from potential harm, such as data misuse by companies or governments, job loss due to political views, and intrusive identification measures. Some also value the freedom to speak anonymously as essential for open discourse. Supporting comments highlight increased accountability as a benefit, suggesting it could reduce cyberbullying, scams, and improve overall behavior online. A minority express conditional support, indicating that the entity requiring registration (e.g., platform vs. government) influences their stance.
