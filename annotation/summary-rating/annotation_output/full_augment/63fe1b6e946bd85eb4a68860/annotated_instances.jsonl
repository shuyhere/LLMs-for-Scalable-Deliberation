Approximately half of the comments express support, citing potential long-term benefits such as economic stabilization, increased federal revenues, protection of domestic industries, and reduced national debt. Supporters often emphasize that initial challenges may lead to future gains and that the policy could help address trade imbalances.</p>\n<p>The other half of comments anticipate negative consequences, including increased consumer prices, higher inflation, strained international relations, and overall economic instability. Critics frequently mention that costs will be passed to consumers, potentially reducing spending and harming middle-class households. Some also express concern about implementation, describing the approach as poorly strategic or confusing for businesses.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments acknowledges mixed or uncertain outcomes, noting that effects may vary by industry or depend on long-term implementation.
