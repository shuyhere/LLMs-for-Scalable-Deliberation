Some use it as a \"tutor\" to understand complex subjects, improve their writing skills, or learn technical information. Others leverage it for creative pursuits, such as generating ideas, assisting with digital art, or helping to visualize concepts. For some, it has been particularly helpful for professional development, assisting with resumes and emails.</p>\n<p>However, the comments also reveal significant concerns and negative consequences. A primary concern revolves around privacy, with individuals expressing worry about their personal data being collected and tracked without their knowledge, describing it as a \"major intrusion.\" Another prominent negative sentiment is a growing sense of distrust and anxiety.
