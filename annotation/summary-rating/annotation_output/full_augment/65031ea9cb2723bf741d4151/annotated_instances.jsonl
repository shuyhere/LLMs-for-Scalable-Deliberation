Supporters often emphasized moral and humanitarian reasons, such as the right to safety, compassion for those in danger, and the U.S.\u2019s historical role as a refuge for immigrants and those fleeing oppression. Many cited the nation\u2019s wealth and resources as justification for helping others and stressed the importance of upholding values like freedom and human dignity.</p>\n<p>While many expressed strong support, a common theme among supporters was the need for thorough vetting processes to ensure national security and prevent abuse of the system. Some also called for integration programs, education on American society, and background checks to ensure that only those genuinely in need are accepted.</p>\n<p>A smaller but notable portion of comments expressed opposition or hesitation. Opponents often cited concerns about the strain on domestic resources, the need to address internal issues first, and the belief that the U.S. is not in a financial or social position to take in more refugees. Some also expressed frustration with the current immigration system and concerns about undocumented immigrants receiving more support than native-born citizens.</p>\n<p>A few individuals were neutral or conflicted, acknowledging the plight of refugees but also expressing uncertainty about the impact on U.S. society, economy, and racial relations. These individuals often called for balanced policies that consider both humanitarian needs and national interests.</p>\n<p>In summary, the comments reflected a strong undercurrent of support for accepting refugees, particularly when framed as a moral duty or a reflection of U.S. values. However, this support was often accompanied by calls for responsible, well-managed policies that ensure national security and equitable resource distribution.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
