The remaining commenters were opposed to the policy.</p>\n<p>The primary arguments in favor of accepting refugees are rooted in humanitarian and moral responsibility. Many feel it is a compassionate duty to help those in life-threatening situations, putting themselves in the refugees' shoes and asserting that every life matters. Some also see it as part of the nation's identity, founded by people fleeing persecution, and believe that accepting refugees adds valuable cultural diversity. One perspective noted that the U.S. has a particular responsibility when its foreign policy contributes to the crises that create refugees.</p>\n<p>However, a large portion of this support comes with important caveats. The most frequently mentioned condition is the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to ensure national security and screen out criminals. Many also believe there should be limits on the number of refugees accepted to avoid overwhelming the nation's resources. These commenters stressed the importance of balancing humanitarian aid with the needs of current citizens, ensuring that resources are not strained and the quality of life for residents is not negatively affected.</p>\n<p>The opposition to accepting more refugees centers on the belief that the country cannot afford it. These commenters argue that the U.S. is already facing significant economic challenges and has a duty to care for its own citizens first. They express concern that accepting more refugees places an undue strain on social systems, the economy, and government expenditures, and that these resources should be directed toward helping Americans in need.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
