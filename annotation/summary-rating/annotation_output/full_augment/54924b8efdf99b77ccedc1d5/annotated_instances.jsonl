Common complaints include the expansion of tipping requests to establishments that traditionally didn't ask for tips, such as counter service, pickup orders, and basic transactions. Many feel that point-of-sale systems with preset tip options create uncomfortable pressure to tip even when minimal or no service is provided. Respondents frequently described feeling \"bullied,\" \"forced,\" or \"manipulated\" into tipping.</p>\n<h6>Support for Fair Wages Over Tips</h6>\n<p>The most common suggestion for improvement was eliminating or reducing reliance on tipping by requiring employers to pay living wages. Many participants view the current system as a way for businesses to shift their responsibility for fair compensation onto customers. Several respondents noted that only the United States has this extensive tipping culture and suggested adopting European or Japanese models where service charges are included or workers receive adequate base pay.</p>\n<h6>Conditional Support for Tipping</h6>\n<p>While most respondents tip regularly, many believe it should be reserved for exceptional service rather than expected for every transaction. About a quarter of participants support tipping when it rewards good service at full-service restaurants or for delivery, but oppose expanding it to counter service or automated transactions. Some respondents who worked for tips themselves still advocate for system reform.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Appropriate Tipping Scenarios</h6>\n<p>Participants generally agree that tipping is most appropriate for:\n- Full-service restaurant servers\n- Food delivery drivers\n- Services involving direct, personalized attention</p>\n<p>They typically oppose tipping for:\n- Counter service or pickup orders\n- Pre-packaged items\n- Fast food establishments\n- Situations where no actual service is provided</p>\n<h6>Suggested Improvements</h6>\n<p>Common proposals include:\n- Establishing living wages for all workers (most frequent suggestion)\n- Making tipping truly optional without pressure\n- Implementing flat service charges instead of variable tips\n- Limiting tip requests to traditional service roles\n- Improving point-of-sale interfaces to make declining tips easier\n- Creating clearer guidelines about when tipping is appropriate</p>\n<p>A minority of respondents support the current system, viewing tips as motivation for good service or a way to help underpaid workers. However, even among supporters, there's recognition that the system has expanded beyond its original intent.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
