Several participants saw the cuts as a political tactic, suggesting the goal was to control the populace by keeping them less educated, punish institutions with opposing political views, or create a less-skilled workforce.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a minority of comments supported or found justification for the funding cuts. These individuals argued that academic institutions have become too focused on \"marxist\" or \"left-leaning\" politics, indoctrination, and DEI initiatives. Others criticized universities for high costs, misuse of funds, and large endowments, suggesting that cuts could force necessary reforms.</p>\n<p>A few comments were more measured or uncertain.
