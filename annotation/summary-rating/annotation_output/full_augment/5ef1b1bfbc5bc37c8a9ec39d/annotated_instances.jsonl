They frequently describe it as a compassionate and ethical responsibility, asserting that everyone deserves safety and a chance to live without fear. Many appeal to empathy, stating that they would want a safe haven if they were in a similar situation. This viewpoint is often connected to American identity, with some noting that the nation was founded by people fleeing persecution and should uphold these values. A few commenters also argue that the U.S. has a particular responsibility to accept refugees from conflicts it may have influenced through its foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, another group of commenters opposes accepting more refugees. The most common reason is the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens' needs first. They express concerns about the strain on national resources, the economy, government debt, and social systems. Some feel the country is already overwhelmed and cannot handle more people, while others suggest refugees should seek asylum in countries closer to their own.</p>\n<p>A substantial portion of the comments represent a conditional or conflicted middle ground. Many who are open to accepting refugees attach strict conditions, with the most common being the need for a thorough and rigorous vetting process to screen for criminal backgrounds and security risks. Another frequently mentioned condition is that accepting refugees should not negatively impact the economy or the quality of life for current citizens. These commenters often express a desire to balance compassion with practical concerns about national security and resource allocation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
