Many express empathy, noting they would want refuge if in similar circumstances. These commenters highlight that refugees are fleeing life-threatening situations and deserve safety and compassion. Several point to America's historical identity as a nation built by those fleeing persecution and see accepting refugees as consistent with core American values. Some also note potential benefits including cultural diversity and population growth in rural areas that could boost local economies.</p>\n<p><strong>Those opposing increased refugee acceptance</strong> primarily cite concerns about domestic priorities and resource limitations. A recurring theme is that the government should \"take care of our own\" before helping others, with specific mentions of national debt and inadequate support for current citizens. Some express frustration that refugees may receive aid that is denied to Americans, viewing this as unfair.
