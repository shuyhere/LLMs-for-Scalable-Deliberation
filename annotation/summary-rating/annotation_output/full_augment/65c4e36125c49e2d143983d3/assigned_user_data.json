Most express concerns about immediate and ongoing economic consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Negative Impacts Identified</strong>:\n- <strong>Price Increases</strong>: The most frequently cited concern is that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers, as companies pass along the increased costs. Many note they are already experiencing these price increases on everyday goods and essentials.\n- <strong>Consumer Burden</strong>: Respondents emphasize that American consumers, not foreign countries, ultimately pay for tariffs through higher prices, which particularly impacts middle-class and low-income households.\n- <strong>Small Business Harm</strong>: Several small business owners report direct negative impacts, including difficulty importing supplies and materials, reduced order volumes, and threats to business viability.\n- <strong>International Relations</strong>: Many worry about damaged trade relationships, retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and America's diminished standing as a reliable trading partner.\n- <strong>Economic Instability</strong>: Concerns include potential recession, reduced consumer spending, job losses, and overall economic uncertainty.</p>\n<p><strong>Minority Positive Views</strong>:\nA smaller portion of respondents believe the tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. economy by:\n- Generating revenue for the federal budget\n- Protecting domestic industries and jobs\n- Creating a \"fair playing field\" in international trade\n- Encouraging domestic manufacturing and reducing dependence on imports\n- Reflecting confidence in Trump's business acumen</p>\n<p><strong>Temporal Perspectives</strong>:\nSome respondents distinguish between short-term and long-term effects, suggesting the policy might cause immediate pain but could potentially yield future benefits if it successfully reshores manufacturing. However, skeptics doubt whether the infrastructure and supply chains needed for domestic production can be rebuilt effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Assessment</strong>:\nThe consensus view is decidedly negative, with respondents describing the tariff policy using terms like \"atrocious,\" \"nonsensical,\" \"joke,\" and \"moronic.\" Even those acknowledging potential long-term benefits express concern about the immediate hardships facing American consumers and businesses.
