Approximately 65% of the comments indicate a belief that the policy will have a negative impact, often citing increased prices for consumers, inflation, and economic instability. Many commenters emphasize that while certain industries may benefit, the broader population\u2014especially middle- and lower-income Americans\u2014will bear the costs through higher living expenses and reduced purchasing power. Some also highlight the potential for trade retaliation from other countries, strained international relationships, and uncertainty in global markets.</p>\n<p>A smaller proportion of the comments (around 25%) view the tariff policy more favorably, arguing that it could lead to long-term economic benefits by encouraging domestic manufacturing, stabilizing the economy, and generating increased tax revenues. These perspectives often reference the administration\u2019s goals of reducing trade deficits and supporting domestic industries, even if the effects are not yet visible.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters (about 10%) acknowledge that the impact may be mixed, with short-term disruptions but potential long-term advantages. These views typically suggest that while tariffs may not immediately reshape trade patterns or bring back manufacturing, they could signal a shift in economic strategy over time.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward skepticism and concern, with many expressing doubt in the effectiveness of the policy and its potential to deliver the promised economic benefits. The fear of inflation, consumer burden, and global economic repercussions is a recurring theme, with a strong emphasis on the need for strategic and balanced trade policies.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
