Supporters emphasized the importance of public health, the role of government in preventing outbreaks, and the responsibility of individuals to contribute to collective well-being. Some acknowledged that while enforcement may be necessary during uncertain times, it can be adjusted as more information becomes available.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller portion of the comments opposed mandatory vaccination, citing concerns about personal beliefs, insufficient long-term research on vaccines, and the belief that enforcement is ineffective since people may not comply regardless.
