Many contributors argue that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices, inflation, and reduced purchasing power, particularly affecting middle- and lower-income households. There is also significant concern about strained international trade relationships, reduced global competitiveness, and the potential for retaliatory measures from other countries. Some commenters emphasize that while certain industries or groups may benefit in the short term, the broader economy and society face long-term risks such as economic instability, reduced investment, and a potential recession.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of the comments suggest a more positive outlook, often tied to long-term economic goals, such as strengthening domestic industries, reducing trade deficits, or increasing federal revenue. These views often reference the strategic vision of the policy, particularly under the Trump administration, and the belief that the benefits may only become apparent over time.</p>\n<p>Mixed perspectives are also present, with some acknowledging both potential short-term disruptions and long-term gains. There is a general consensus that the policy is complex and that its full effects are difficult to predict, especially given the evolving nature of global supply chains and economic interdependence.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward the belief that the current tariff policy is having or will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and society, primarily due to its effects on consumer prices, inflation, and international trade relations.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
