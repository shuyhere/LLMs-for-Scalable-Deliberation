Many express that tipping should be reserved for situations where genuine, personalized service is provided, such as at sit-down restaurants.</p>\n<p>A prevalent theme is the belief that employers should pay a living wage, reducing workers' reliance on tips and shifting the financial responsibility from the consumer to the business. Numerous comments reference systems in place in Europe or Japan, where service charges are included or tipping is less common, as preferable models.</p>\n<p>There is significant criticism of the pressure and discomfort caused by digital point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip during every transaction. Many suggest these systems should be less intrusive and that a \"no tip\" option should be more accessible.</p>\n<p>Opinions on the act of tipping itself are mixed. A minority view it positively as a reward for exceptional service or a way to supplement income, but a larger portion sees it as an obligatory practice that subsidizes low wages. There is a clear desire for tipping to return to being a voluntary gesture of appreciation for good service, rather than a socially mandatory expectation. The overarching sentiment is a call for systemic change to ensure fair worker compensation and to redefine the role of tipping.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
