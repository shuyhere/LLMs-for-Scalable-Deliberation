A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current structure, arguing that it allows employers to pay substandard wages while expecting customers to compensate through tips. Many suggest eliminating the tipping system altogether and instead ensuring that service workers receive a livable hourly wage.</p>\n<p>Others propose modifications to the system, such as making tipping optional, removing mandatory tipping prompts, or integrating service charges into the bill to make the process more transparent and less manipulative. Some suggest alternative incentives for tipping, such as receiving a thank-you note or a coupon in return, to make the practice more voluntary and meaningful.</p>\n<p>There is also a recurring idea that tipping should be based on the quality of service and that customers should not be expected to tip for minimal or no service. A few comments highlight the cultural uniqueness of the U.S. tipping system and suggest looking to other countries, such as those in Europe, for alternative models where service charges are built into the cost of the service.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward reforming or replacing the current tipping system with a more equitable and transparent approach that ensures fair compensation for workers without pressuring customers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
