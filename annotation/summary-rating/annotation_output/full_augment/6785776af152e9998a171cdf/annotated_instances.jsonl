There is a strong sentiment that tipping should be tied to the quality of service and should never be mandatory or coercive.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the call for fair wages for service workers, with several commenters emphasizing that employees should not be dependent on tips to earn a living. It was suggested that businesses should take on more responsibility by providing a livable hourly wage, which would reduce the reliance on customer generosity.</p>\n<p>Some proposed alternative models for tipping, such as replacing percentage-based tipping with fixed amounts or offering tangible benefits in exchange for tips (e.g., thank-you notes, coupons). Others argued that tipping should be a voluntary gesture of appreciation rather than an expectation.</p>\n<p>There was also acknowledgment that tipping can be beneficial when it reflects genuine gratitude for good service, but it should not be a financial burden on customers or a substitute for fair compensation for workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
