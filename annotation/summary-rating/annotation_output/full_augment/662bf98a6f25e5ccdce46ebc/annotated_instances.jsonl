A significant portion of respondents express frustration with what they perceive as an expanding and increasingly mandatory tipping culture.</p>\n<h6>Opposition to Current Tipping Practices</h6>\n<p>Many participants advocate for eliminating the tipping system entirely, viewing it as a mechanism that allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers. These respondents argue that businesses should pay livable wages rather than relying on customer tips to supplement inadequate base pay. Several specifically criticize the proliferation of tipping requests in situations where minimal or no service is provided, such as counter service, pickup orders, or simple transactions.</p>\n<h6>Concerns About Tipping Expansion</h6>\n<p>A recurring theme is frustration with digital point-of-sale systems that present tipping options for every transaction. Respondents describe feeling pressured or \"bullied\" into tipping, particularly when declining requires multiple steps or feels socially uncomfortable. Many distinguish between traditional service situations (sit-down restaurants, delivery) where tipping seems appropriate, and newer contexts (coffee shops, takeout) where tipping requests feel excessive.</p>\n<h6>Support for Merit-Based Tipping</h6>\n<p>Among those who support tipping, most emphasize it should be voluntary and based on service quality. These respondents view tips as rewards for exceptional service rather than obligations. Some appreciate tipping as an incentive system that motivates better service, while others see it as a way to show gratitude for hard work in demanding service positions.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Reforms</h6>\n<p>Suggested improvements include:\n- Implementing living wages for all workers to make tipping truly optional\n- Adding automatic service charges (with suggestions ranging from 10% to amounts incorporated into menu prices)\n- Simplifying digital interfaces to make \"no tip\" options more accessible\n- Limiting tip requests to traditional full-service situations\n- Following international models, particularly European systems without tipping expectations</p>\n<h6>Worker Compensation Concerns</h6>\n<p>Throughout the comments, there's widespread acknowledgment that many service workers, particularly servers earning as little as $2.13 per hour, depend on tips for survival. Even those opposed to tipping culture often express sympathy for workers caught in this system and continue tipping out of concern for their welfare.</p>\n<p>The overall sentiment suggests that while people generally want to support service workers, many feel the current tipping system has become burdensome, confusing, and unfairly shifts employer responsibilities to consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
