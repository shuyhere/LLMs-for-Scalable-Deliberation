Supporters frequently mention the need for herd immunity, the greater good, and the role of science in guiding these decisions.</p>\n<p>However, a significant portion of comments oppose enforced vaccination, citing concerns over personal freedom, distrust in government or vaccine safety, and the belief that medical choices should remain individual. Some opposition is rooted in negative experiences during recent epidemics, such as concerns over rapid vaccine development or perceived government overreach.
