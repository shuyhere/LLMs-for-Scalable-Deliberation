A smaller share oppose it outright, and some offer conditional or partial support.</li>\n<li>Reasons for support:</li>\n<li>Healthcare seen as a basic human right that shouldn\u2019t depend on income or employment.</li>\n<li>Current US system is viewed as unaffordable, inequitable, and inefficient, leading to medical debt and delayed care.</li>\n<li>Universal/basic coverage is believed to improve access to preventive and early treatment, reduce long-term costs, and yield better health outcomes.</li>\n<li>Economic and societal benefits cited include protecting workers\u2019 productivity, national competitiveness, and public health.</li>\n<li>Many point to other developed countries (e.g., Canada, UK) as proof of feasibility; some suggest expanding Medicare as a foundation.</li>\n<li>Desire to reduce the influence of for-profit insurers whose incentives may conflict with patient care.</li>\n<li>Concerns and reasons for opposition:</li>\n<li>Fears of higher taxes, government inefficiency, waste, and bureaucracy.</li>\n<li>Worries about longer wait times and declines in quality or choice.</li>\n<li>Objections to expanded government role and increased public dependency; preference for private-sector solutions.</li>\n<li>Concerns about crowding out private insurance and fairness to those who pay more or work.</li>\n<li>Conditional/qualified views:</li>\n<li>Support if a public option exists alongside private plans to preserve choice.</li>\n<li>Ensure timely access and maintain quality; avoid excessive monitoring or red tape.</li>\n<li>Some want coverage limited to citizens or targeted to those who cannot afford private insurance.</li>\n<li>Interest in including dental, vision, and mental health; emphasis on preventive care.</li>\n<li>Support for a basic \u201cfloor\u201d of coverage with the ability to buy supplemental insurance.</li>\n<li>Lived experiences:</li>\n<li>Several describe difficulty affording premiums, coping with medical debt, losing coverage after job loss, or navigating slow, complex enrollment processes.</li>\n<li>Personal stories highlight unmet needs in mental health, dental, vision, and care for chronic conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In sum, most commenters favor a government role in guaranteeing basic health coverage on moral, economic, and public health grounds, while skeptics focus on cost, efficiency, and quality. Many propose a hybrid model that ensures a universal baseline with options for private supplementation, clear standards for timely care, and streamlined administration.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
