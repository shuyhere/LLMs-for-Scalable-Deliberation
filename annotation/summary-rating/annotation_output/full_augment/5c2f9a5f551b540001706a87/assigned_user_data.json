Several describe shorter device lifespans, bugs after updates, and reduced support that effectively forces upgrades.\n- Environmental and financial impacts are recurring themes: electronic waste, unnecessary consumption, rising prices, and added costs from changing accessories/chargers. Some also note privacy worries tied to software updates, and supply-chain factors like tariffs complicating costs.\n- Preferences trend toward a slower, more sustainable cadence: longer release intervals (often 2\u20133 years), extended software/security support, better durability and repairability, and greater standardization (e.g., chargers).
