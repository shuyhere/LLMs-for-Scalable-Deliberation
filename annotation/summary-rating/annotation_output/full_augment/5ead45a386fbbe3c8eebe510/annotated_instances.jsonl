Several highlight potential \u201cbrain drain\u201d and lost breakthroughs in areas like medical research.\n- Fairness and access: Concerns that cuts will limit resources, opportunities, and safety in schools, and damage trust in institutions.\n- Political motives: Some see the move as politically driven\u2014either as an attempt to weaken independent thinking and public oversight or as a justified response to perceived ideological bias in academia.\n- Fiscal balance: A minority advocate targeted reductions or accountability for waste but stress the need for alternatives and a balanced approach to preserve core education and research.\n- A few participants express uncertainty or focus on personal resilience rather than the policy itself.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
