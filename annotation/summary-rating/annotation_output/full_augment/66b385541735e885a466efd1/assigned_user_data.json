The most common concern was the negative long-term impact on the country's future, with many stating that education is the foundation of society and essential for innovation, economic strength, and global competitiveness. Participants argued that such cuts would lead to a \"brain drain\" of researchers to other countries, stifle scientific and medical advancements, and create future skill gaps in the workforce.</p>\n<p>Many also focused on the direct harm to individuals, particularly students. They noted that reduced funding would limit opportunities, make higher education less accessible for low-income students, and hinder social mobility. Several participants shared personal connections, expressing concern for family members in college or how the cuts have already affected programs they rely on.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme among those opposed was the belief that the cuts were politically motivated. Some suggested the goal was to control the populace by keeping them less educated, to punish institutions with perceived liberal leanings, or to divert funds to other priorities like tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a smaller group of participants expressed support for or justification of the funding cuts. Their primary argument was that academic institutions have become centers for \"left-leaning\" or \"marxist\" indoctrination and are too focused on initiatives like DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) rather than education. Some also argued that universities are financially inefficient, mismanage funds, or have large endowments and therefore do not need taxpayer money.</p>\n<p>A few individuals held a more nuanced or undecided view.
