About 60% opposed the idea, roughly 20% supported it, and about 20% offered conditional or mixed support.</p>\n<p>Key reasons for opposition:\n- Privacy and data security concerns, including fears of intrusive ID checks, corporate data collection, and potential government misuse.\n- Chilling effects on free speech and personal safety, especially around political viewpoints and employment risks.\n- A strong preference for the freedom to remain anonymous online.\n- Doubts about practical enforcement without invasive measures.</p>\n<p>Reasons for support:\n- Greater accountability leading to better behavior online.\n- Potential reduction in cyberbullying, harassment, and scams.</p>\n<p>Conditional views and nuances:\n- More acceptable if implemented by platforms rather than mandated by government.\n- Some see it as suitable for social media but still value spaces for anonymity.\n- Preference for voluntary real-name use rather than a universal requirement.</p>\n<p>In short, most comments prioritize privacy and freedom of expression over mandatory identity disclosure, while a minority emphasize accountability and harm reduction. Several suggest platform-led or optional approaches as a compromise.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
