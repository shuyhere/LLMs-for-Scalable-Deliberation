Many express concern that tariffs function as a tax passed directly to consumers, reducing purchasing power and potentially leading to decreased spending, job losses, and broader economic instability. Others note damage to international relations, loss of U.S. soft power, and the likelihood of retaliatory measures from trading partners.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage view the tariffs positively, arguing they will benefit the U.S. economy in the long term by addressing trade imbalances, protecting domestic industries, and encouraging reshoring of production. Some supporters acknowledge short-term challenges but believe the policy will ultimately strengthen national revenue and foster fairer trade.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments suggest mixed or uncertain outcomes, recognizing potential benefits for specific sectors but expressing worry about overall disruption, market uncertainty, and implementation flaws. The overarching sentiment leans toward skepticism regarding the policy's effectiveness and fairness, with emphasis on its disproportionate impact on average consumers and smaller enterprises.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
