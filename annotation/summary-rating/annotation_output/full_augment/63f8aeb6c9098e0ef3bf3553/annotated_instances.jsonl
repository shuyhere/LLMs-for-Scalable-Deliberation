At the same time, there are clear reservations: concerns about authenticity, the potential for undue influence, annoyance with perceived inauthenticity, and trend-chasing that can reduce originality. Several emphasize the need for responsibility, transparency, and maintaining trust to balance their growing cultural impact.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
