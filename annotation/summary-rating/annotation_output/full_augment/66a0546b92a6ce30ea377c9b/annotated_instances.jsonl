Approximately 60% oppose it, about 15% support it, and roughly 25% express mixed or conditional views.\n- Main reasons for opposition: privacy and data-security risks (intrusive ID checks, potential data sales, government access, hacks/leaks); personal safety concerns (doxxing, stalking, domestic abuse survivors, risks to marginalized groups); fear of professional or social repercussions for lawful speech; belief that anonymity enables healthy participation and support communities; doubts about enforceability and the possibility of forged identities; concern that tying identities could even worsen harassment by exposing targets.\n- Reasons for support: increased accountability and better behavior online; reduction in harassment, cyberbullying, scams, and catfishing; greater trust and credibility.\n- Conditional/compromise ideas: acceptable if required by platforms rather than governments; back-end verification with front-end pseudonyms, revealing identity only for serious violations; optional real-name use; recognition that benefits depend on strong data protection and that bad actors may still evade rules.\n- Overall, commenters value privacy and safety highly, favoring approaches that balance accountability with the ability to participate pseudonymously, rather than blanket real-name mandates.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
