Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing. This comparison reinforces the view that the American tipping system is unique and potentially problematic.</p>\n<p>The consensus suggests strong dissatisfaction with how tipping culture has evolved, with most preferring either its elimination in favor of fair wages or its return to being a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than an expected supplement to inadequate pay.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "web-rev-claude-opus-4-20250514", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 50, "num_samples_group_b": 90, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Based on the comments provided, here is an overall summary of opinions on the tipping system:</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition to Current Tipping Culture</strong>\nThe overwhelming majority of respondents express frustration with the current tipping system.
