Many feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with establishments requesting tips in situations where they weren't traditionally expected. People particularly object to being asked for tips at pickup counters, drive-throughs, and for minimal service transactions. The proliferation of digital payment systems with automatic tipping prompts is seen as pressuring customers into tipping when it may not be warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Living Wages</strong>\nA significant portion of respondents advocate for eliminating or reforming the tipping system by ensuring workers receive fair, livable wages from their employers. Many believe the responsibility for paying employees adequately should rest with businesses, not customers. Several suggest that the current system allows employers to underpay workers while shifting the burden to consumers.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Support for Tipping</strong>\nWhile many oppose the current system, some respondents support tipping when it's voluntary and based on quality of service. They believe tips should reward exceptional service rather than subsidize inadequate wages. Several express that they always tip generously at restaurants but object to the expansion of tipping expectations to other sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong>\nCommon suggestions for improvement include:\n- Implementing a standard service charge (often mentioned as 10%) instead of variable tipping\n- Raising minimum wages, particularly for tipped workers who currently earn as little as $2.13 per hour\n- Making \"no tip\" options more accessible on digital payment systems\n- Limiting tipping to traditional full-service restaurants\n- Following models from other countries where tipping is minimal or unnecessary</p>\n<p><strong>Cultural Perspectives</strong>\nMany respondents reference international practices, particularly in Europe and Japan, where workers receive adequate wages and tipping is either minimal or incorporated into pricing.

There is strong support for making tipping optional, clearly presented as such at checkout (with an easy \u201cno tip\u201d option), and tied to the quality of service rather than an expectation in every interaction.</p>\n<p>A dominant theme is shifting responsibility back to employers: paying a fair, livable wage (at least full minimum wage for tipped workers) so workers don\u2019t have to rely on tips for basic income. Numerous commenters favor eliminating or reducing tipping by raising menu prices, integrating a standard service charge into the bill (often cited around 10%), or adopting European-style systems where gratuity is included and tips are rare bonuses. Others see tipping as a necessary stopgap until wages rise, while a smaller group strongly endorses tipping as an incentive (often 20%+), with a few suggesting fixed-dollar tips rather than percentages or even mandatory tips in limited cases.</p>\n<p>Common ground across viewpoints includes: tipping should reward good or exceptional service; customers shouldn\u2019t be pressured; counter-service and simple transactions generally shouldn\u2019t solicit tips; and workers deserve predictable, fair pay. Additional, less frequent suggestions include reducing suggested tip percentages, ensuring tips are untaxed, employers matching a portion of tips, or offering small acknowledgments (thank-you notes/coupons) when tips are given.</p>\n<p>In short, most want a system that ensures stable, livable wages for workers and restores tipping to a voluntary, service-based bonus\u2014while curbing intrusive prompts and limiting who is tipped to contexts where meaningful service is provided.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
