A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current tipping system, particularly its perceived overreach into everyday transactions and the pressure it places on consumers. Many commenters argue that tipping has become a norm rather than a voluntary gesture, with some noting that it is increasingly expected even for minimal or no service\u2014such as for pickup orders, drive-thru, or simple retail transactions.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the idea that the tipping system is often used to justify low base wages for service workers. Many commenters advocate for the elimination of tipping in favor of a model where employees receive a fair, livable wage from their employers. Others suggest alternatives such as a fixed service charge added to the bill, similar to systems in place in other countries.</p>\n<p>For those who support tipping, it is often framed as a way to reward excellent service and show appreciation for workers. However, there is a clear consensus that tipping should be optional and tied directly to the quality of service provided, not as a requirement for receiving basic service.</p>\n<p>There is also concern about the way tipping is presented to consumers, particularly through point-of-sale systems that default to suggested tip amounts or make it difficult to leave no tip at all. Many commenters suggest that the system should be more transparent and less manipulative.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights the need for a more equitable and less intrusive approach to tipping. While some support its continued use for exceptional service, the majority believe that the system is broken and should be reformed or replaced with a model that ensures fair wages for workers without placing the financial burden on consumers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
