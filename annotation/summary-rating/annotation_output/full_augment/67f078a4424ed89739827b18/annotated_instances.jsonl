Many highlight the importance of using available resources to assist others and stress that accepting refugees is a reflection of kindness and humanitarian values.</p>\n<p>However, some comments include concerns about the impact on American citizens and the strain on social systems. These perspectives advocate for stricter vetting processes, integration support, and limits to ensure that the acceptance of refugees does not negatively affect the quality of life for current residents.
