Respondents frequently mention concerns about corporate data practices, government surveillance, and the potential for real-world consequences from online activity. The discussion reveals deep tensions between creating safer online spaces and preserving the internet's traditional openness and anonymity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
