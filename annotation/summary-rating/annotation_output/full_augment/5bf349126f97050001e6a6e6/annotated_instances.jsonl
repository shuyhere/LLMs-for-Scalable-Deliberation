Many express frustration with the expectation of tipping for minimal or no service, particularly in contexts like counter service or takeout, where it feels unnecessary or pressured. There is strong support for eliminating tipping in favor of employers paying a living wage, ensuring workers do not have to rely on tips to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>A common suggestion is to integrate tipping into the bill as a standard service charge or to abolish it entirely, aligning with practices in places like Europe where service is included. Some propose that tipping should remain as a voluntary gesture for exceptional service rather than an expectation. There is also discussion around making tipping amounts fixed rather than percentage-based to ensure fairness.</p>\n<p>Overall, the comments reflect a desire for a system where workers are compensated fairly by their employers, reducing the burden on customers to subsidize wages, while still allowing for optional gratuity as a genuine token of appreciation for outstanding service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
