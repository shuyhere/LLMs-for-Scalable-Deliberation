A significant portion of the feedback criticizes the current tipping culture, particularly its overuse and the pressure it places on customers. Many argue that tipping should be reserved for situations where direct service is provided and should never be mandatory or implied. Some commenters express discomfort with the expectation to tip in fast food, takeout, or self-service settings, where they feel the practice is unnecessary or manipulative.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that service workers should be paid a fair, livable wage rather than relying on tips. Over half of the comments suggest that tipping should be eliminated or significantly reformed, with a service charge added to the bill instead. Others propose standardizing tipping amounts or making it more transparent and voluntary.</p>\n<p>While some commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, they emphasize that it should not be tied to poor wages or used as a way for employers to avoid fair compensation.
