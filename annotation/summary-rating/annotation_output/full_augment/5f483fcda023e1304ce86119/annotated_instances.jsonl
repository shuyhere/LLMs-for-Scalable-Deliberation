A significant portion of comments emphasizes the necessity for thorough vetting processes to ensure national security and screen for individuals with criminal backgrounds.

This includes worries about overburdening social systems, straining the economy, and ensuring that current citizens have adequate access to resources before or while accepting newcomers.</p>\n<p>A smaller but notable perspective opposes accepting more refugees, primarily based on the belief that the nation should prioritize addressing its own internal problems and supporting its current citizens before assisting those from abroad.
