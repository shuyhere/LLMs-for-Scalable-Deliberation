The role remains accessible and entrepreneurial, involves more flexibility and new opportunities, but all also come with risks such as an unstable income stream, lack of control over platform instability, and performance pressures that affect their mental well-being. Influencing may not be a \u201ctraditional\u201d industry, but does require genuine skill in content development, branding, and communicating, thus influencing should qualify as real work - albeit a challenging, competitive, and ultimately riskier pathway."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 24m 37s "}}
