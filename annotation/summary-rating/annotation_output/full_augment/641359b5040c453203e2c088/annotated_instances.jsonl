Many cite pandemic experience as evidence that mandates can be necessary, with some emphasizing time-limited, evidence-based measures (strong early action, then rollback as knowledge improves) and support contingent on vaccines being well-tested and proven effective.\n- A minority (about 20%) opposes mandates, prioritizing individual choice and diverse beliefs, questioning the effectiveness of enforcement, and expressing concerns about rapid vaccine development and potential adverse effects. Some in this group prefer strong encouragement and education over compulsory measures.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?

Epidemics spread in ways that make personal choice ripple into collective consequences. If someone refuses vaccination or quarantine during a dangerous outbreak, that decision doesn\u2019t just affect them\u2014it endangers everyone they come into contact with, especially vulnerable groups.\r\n\r\nThat said, I\u2019d want strict safeguards: clear communication about why the measures are needed, time limits, accountability, and ensuring that policies are based on the best available science rather than politics.
