The majority of respondents view tipping culture as having expanded beyond reasonable boundaries and becoming problematic.</p>\n<h6>Main Concerns About Current System</h6>\n<p>A significant portion of respondents feel that tipping has become excessive and intrusive, with many establishments now requesting tips for minimal or no service. People express frustration with point-of-sale systems that make declining tips awkward or difficult. Many note that what were once simple transactions now involve navigating tip screens, creating uncomfortable social pressure.</p>\n<p>The expansion of tipping expectations beyond traditional service roles is a common complaint. Respondents specifically mention being asked to tip for counter service, pickup orders, and other situations where minimal service is provided. This \"tip creep\" is seen as particularly problematic.</p>\n<h6>Proposed Solutions</h6>\n<p>The most frequently suggested solution is eliminating tipping entirely in favor of employers paying livable wages. Many respondents advocate for this approach, arguing that workers shouldn't have to rely on tips for basic income. Some suggest implementing a mandatory service charge (often 10%) as an alternative to discretionary tipping.</p>\n<p>Several respondents propose that tipping should return to being truly optional and based on exceptional service rather than an expected part of every transaction. They want tipping to be a reward for quality service rather than a subsidy for inadequate wages.</p>\n<h6>Perspectives on Worker Compensation</h6>\n<p>There's strong consensus that service workers, particularly in restaurants, are underpaid and deserve fair compensation. However, respondents disagree on whether tipping or higher base wages better serve workers' interests. While some appreciate that tipping can allow workers to earn above minimum wage, others see it as enabling employer exploitation.</p>\n<h6>International Comparisons</h6>\n<p>Multiple respondents reference other countries' systems, particularly in Europe and Japan, where tipping is minimal or non-existent and service charges are included in pricing. These models are generally viewed favorably as alternatives to the American system.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a growing dissatisfaction with tipping culture's current state, with most respondents favoring either significant reform or complete elimination of the practice in favor of fair wages and transparent pricing.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
