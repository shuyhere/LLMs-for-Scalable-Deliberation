Many argue that it promotes planned obsolescence, where companies intentionally design products with limited longevity to encourage frequent replacements.

Some commenters feel that the changes between models are minimal and do not justify the cost or the environmental impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns About Consumerism and Waste:</strong>\nThere is a strong concern that the cycle encourages unnecessary consumption and a culture of disposability. Many believe that the frequent release of new models is a marketing strategy rather than a genuine response to technological need. The environmental impact\u2014such as increased electronic waste and the depletion of natural resources\u2014is frequently mentioned as a major downside.</p>\n<p><strong>Security and Functionality:</strong>\nWhile some updates are welcomed for their role in enhancing security and functionality, others criticize the intrusive nature of certain updates, particularly those that may compromise user privacy or introduce bugs that disrupt device performance.
