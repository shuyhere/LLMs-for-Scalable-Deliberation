Many pointed to the inability of unemployed or underemployed individuals to afford insurance, creating a system where access to healthcare depends on economic status rather than need.</p>\n<h6>Healthcare as a Fundamental Right</h6>\n<p>Multiple respondents framed healthcare as a basic human right rather than a luxury or privilege. This perspective emphasizes that everyone needs healthcare at some point in their lives, and access shouldn't be determined by ability to pay. Some noted that people shouldn't face death or suffering simply because they cannot afford treatment.</p>\n<h6>Government's Role and Responsibility</h6>\n<p>Several comments addressed the fundamental purpose of government, arguing that ensuring citizens' health falls within the government's responsibility to protect the safety and wellbeing of its population. This view sees healthcare provision as a core governmental function, similar to other public services.</p>\n<h6>International Comparisons and Practical Benefits</h6>\n<p>Respondents frequently referenced other countries' successful implementation of universal healthcare, suggesting these systems work effectively elsewhere. Specific benefits mentioned include:\n- More efficient and cost-effective care through universal participation\n- Better diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions\n- Reduced overall costs compared to private systems\n- Improved competitiveness in the global economy</p>\n<h6>National Security and Economic Competitiveness</h6>\n<p>One perspective framed universal healthcare as essential for maintaining American workers' ability to compete globally, elevating the issue beyond individual welfare to national economic and security interests.</p>\n<h6>Qualified Support</h6>\n<p>While overwhelmingly supportive, at least one respondent expressed conditional support, favoring government provision of healthcare as long as it doesn't become the only available option, suggesting a preference for maintaining some choice in the system.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
