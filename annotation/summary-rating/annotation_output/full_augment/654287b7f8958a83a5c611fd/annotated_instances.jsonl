They favor targeting cuts at wealthy institutions, reducing DEI-related programs, shifting control to states/localities, and using cuts to spur reform.\n- Mixed/conditional views: Some call for a balanced approach\u2014trimming waste while protecting core teaching, research, and student aid\u2014and a few say they need more details before forming a judgment.\n- Tone: Largely urgent and negative, often expressing anger, frustration, and worry about long-term national consequences, with a small share expressing trust that the policy has valid reasons or will be manageable.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
