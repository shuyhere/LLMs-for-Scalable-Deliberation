Many argue that access to healthcare is essential for public health, economic stability, and social equity, citing the high costs and inefficiencies of the current private system. A significant portion of respondents point to other developed nations with universal healthcare as successful models the U.S. should emulate. Concerns about affordability, medical debt, and preventive care are frequently mentioned as reasons for support.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express opposition or caution, primarily centered around concerns over government inefficiency, potential declines in quality of care, and worries about increased taxpayer burden. Some suggest a hybrid system that includes both public and private options, emphasizing choice and timely care. A few comments specifically stress that any government-provided insurance should be efficient, accessible, and limited to citizens. Despite these reservations, the prevailing sentiment is that universal healthcare is a moral and practical necessity for ensuring all individuals can access essential medical services without financial hardship.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
