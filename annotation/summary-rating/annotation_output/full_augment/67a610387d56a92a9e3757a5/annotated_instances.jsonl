The most common concern was that tariffs lead to higher prices for consumer goods, as companies pass the increased costs on to their customers. This was described as a direct financial burden on everyday Americans, increasing inflation and making it harder for people to afford essentials. Several participants noted the detrimental effect on international relations, stating that the policy hurts the U.S.'s relationship with trading partners, could lead to retaliatory tariffs, and isolates the country from global trade. The negative impact on businesses, particularly small businesses, was also a key theme. Some argued that the policy is ineffective at its stated goal of reshoring jobs, suggesting that companies would rather raise prices or wait out the policy than move manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a smaller portion of comments argued for a positive impact. Many of these supporters acknowledged potential short-term difficulties but believed the policy would yield long-term benefits for the U.S. economy. Reasons for this positive outlook included the belief that tariffs correct unfair trade practices where other countries have taken advantage of the U.S., encourage the purchase of American-made goods, and ultimately help the national budget and lift Americans out of poverty. Some also expressed confidence in the administration's business expertise to secure a better economic future.</p>\n<p>A few comments presented a more mixed or uncertain view, suggesting the policy has both positive effects (protecting certain industries) and negative effects (raising costs). Others felt the policy's impact was minimal, believing that companies are finding ways to work around it.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
