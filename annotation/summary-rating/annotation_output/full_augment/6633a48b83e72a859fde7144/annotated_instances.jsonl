Many still tip regularly but dislike feeling obligated or being asked before service is delivered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay and responsibility: A strong theme is that employers should pay a fair, livable base wage (at least minimum wage for tipped workers), so tips become a true bonus rather than a necessity. Many would abolish tipping entirely or replace it with higher menu prices or a built-in service charge. Some prefer keeping tips but only as optional and tied to excellent service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where tipping is appropriate: Broad agreement that tipping should primarily apply to full-service restaurants and delivery. Many oppose tipping for simple transactions (coffee, pickup, retail counters) or when customers serve themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How to improve the system:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Reduce pressure and manipulation: make \u201cno tip\u201d easy to find, don\u2019t prompt before service, and avoid default high suggested percentages.</li>\n<li>Tie tips to service quality and make them clearly optional.</li>\n<li>Consider alternatives: integrate service charges (e.g., 10%) into bills with tips optional; raise wages and eliminate tipping; adopt European/Japanese-style norms; limit who is tipped; reduce or remove taxes on tips; employer contributions or matching to stabilize income.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clarify norms: limit tipping requests to contexts with clear, provided service; potentially reserve tipping for complex orders; reduce suggested tip rates; present less intrusive prompts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minority/pro-tipping views: A smaller share strongly supports tipping as an incentive, sometimes advocating high or even mandatory tips (e.g., 20\u201330%) unless wages meet a threshold. A few propose standardizing tips (fixed dollar amounts) or expanding tipping as a general gesture of appreciation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Common ground: Tips, if used, should reward good service rather than compensate for low wages; customers want transparency, choice, and less social pressure; and workers should have predictable, fair income without relying on customer generosity.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
