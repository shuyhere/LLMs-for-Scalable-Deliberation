A majority of commentators believe the system allows employers to underpay their staff, unfairly shifting the responsibility of providing a livable wage from the business to the customer. This has led to a sense that tipping is no longer a voluntary reward for good service but an obligatory and often pressured act.</p>\n<p>Many express frustration with \"tip creep,\" where they are prompted to tip for transactions involving minimal or no service, which they feel is excessive. The consensus is that tipping should be optional and reserved as a genuine expression of gratitude for high-quality service, not an automatic expectation.</p>\n<p>The most frequently proposed solution is to eliminate the reliance on tips by requiring employers to pay a livable base wage. This would make tipping truly optional, similar to the model used in many European countries. Other suggestions for reform include replacing the current system with a mandatory service charge, standardizing tip amounts to prevent manipulation, or shifting from a percentage-based model to fixed-dollar amounts. A few unique ideas were also mentioned, such as providing a coupon or thank-you note in exchange for a tip.</p>\n<p>Overall, while some people continue to tip out of a sense of duty to support underpaid workers, the prevailing sentiment is that the system is fundamentally flawed, out of control, and in need of significant change.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
