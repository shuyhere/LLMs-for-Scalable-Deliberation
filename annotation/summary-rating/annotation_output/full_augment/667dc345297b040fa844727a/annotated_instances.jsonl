Roughly 80% express support (most of it conditional), about 17% oppose, and a small share are undecided or mixed.\n- Reasons for support: Strong humanitarian duty and empathy; belief that people deserve safety; alignment with national values of offering refuge; acknowledgment of possible U.S. responsibility when foreign policy contributes to crises; potential benefits from cultural diversity; and ideas for practical resettlement (e.g., directing newcomers to rural areas, skills training, temporary camps).\n- Common conditions and safeguards: Rigorous vetting to exclude criminals and security risks; distinguishing genuine refugees from economic migrants; setting limits or caps; ensuring the economy and public services aren\u2019t negatively affected; prioritizing citizen needs alongside refugee support; providing integration support (civics, language, cultural orientation).\n- Reasons for opposition: Concerns about fiscal strain, national debt, and pressure on housing and social services; belief that the country should first address domestic needs; worries about overcrowding; preference that refugees seek safety in neighboring countries; fear that numbers will escalate over time; and frustration with perceived inequities compared to aid for citizens.\n- Middle ground: Several commenters are conflicted\u2014supporting aid to people in danger but insisting on robust processes, clear eligibility criteria, and careful resource management.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
