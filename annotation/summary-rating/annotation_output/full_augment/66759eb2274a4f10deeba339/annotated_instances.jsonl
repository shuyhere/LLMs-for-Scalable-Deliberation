A significant portion of users express opposition, primarily citing concerns about privacy infringement, potential data misuse by platforms or governments, and risks to vulnerable individuals (such as those fearing harassment, doxxing, or political persecution). Many argue that anonymity protects free expression and safety, particularly for marginalized groups.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a substantial number of supporters believe real-name registration would enhance accountability, reduce harmful behaviors like cyberbullying and scams, curb misinformation, and help verify authentic users. Some suggest compromises, such as optional real names, backend verification without public disclosure, or verified badges for certain accounts.</p>\n<p>A smaller group expresses mixed or conditional views, acknowledging both benefits (e.g., reducing bots and impersonation) and drawbacks (e.g., data breach risks). Overall, the deliberation highlights tension between safety/accountability and privacy/freedom, with no clear consensus but emphasis on context-dependent implementation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
