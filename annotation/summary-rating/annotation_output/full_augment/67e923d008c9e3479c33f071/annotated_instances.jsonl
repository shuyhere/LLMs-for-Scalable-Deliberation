Many see annual hardware refreshes as incremental, marketing-driven, and a form of planned obsolescence that pushes unnecessary upgrades. Key concerns include environmental harm from e-waste, high and rising prices (exacerbated by supply-chain issues and tariffs), reduced longevity and support for older devices, poor repairability, accessory/charger changes, and buggy or intrusive software updates that can force upgrades. Several comments describe financial strain and consumer fatigue, and a few note broader social downsides (e.g., leaving people behind, impacts on youth).</p>\n<p>A minority appreciates the fast pace for driving innovation, performance, security improvements, and better cameras/features, while still acknowledging cost and sustainability issues. Some expect the pace to slow due to diminishing returns between generations. Many prefer keeping devices for multiple years and upgrading only when necessary.</p>\n<p>Common suggestions:\n- Shift to a slower, more meaningful cadence (e.g., major releases every 2\u20133 years).\n- Prioritize longer software and security support for existing devices.\n- Emphasize durability, repairability, and standardized chargers to cut waste.\n- Focus more on software improvements rather than frequent new hardware.\n- Improve testing to reduce bugs and intrusive data practices in updates.\n- Be more transparent in marketing and moderate prices.\n- Educate consumers that recent models remain capable for years.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
