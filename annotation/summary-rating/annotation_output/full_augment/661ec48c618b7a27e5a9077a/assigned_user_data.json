Commonly cited risks include reduced access and equity (especially for low-income families), weakened public schools, stalled research and innovation (notably in medical fields), brain drain to other countries, skill gaps in the workforce, and diminished social mobility.

A few suggest cuts could spur overdue overhauls.\n- Neutral/uncertain: A small portion express limited knowledge or no strong feelings, emphasizing the need for details.\n- Areas of convergence: Even among those open to reductions, there is emphasis on protecting core educational access and critical research, pursuing targeted efficiencies rather than sweeping cuts, and balancing fiscal restraint with investment in long-term national capacity.\n- Tone: Highly polarized, with much of the commentary using strong language to condemn the decision, while a smaller contingent endorses cuts on ideological and efficiency grounds.</p>", "type": "rating", "model": "gpt-5", "num_samples_group": NaN, "num_samples_group_a": 50, "num_samples_group_b": 30, "summary_length": NaN, "model_a": NaN, "model_b": NaN, "summary_a_id": NaN, "summary_b_id": NaN, "summary_a_text": NaN, "summary_b_text": NaN, "summary_length_a": NaN, "summary_length_b": NaN, "displayed_text": "<h4>Below is a summary of people's opinions on the issue.</h4><hr><p>Overall summary:\n- Predominant view: Strong opposition to cutting academic funding.
