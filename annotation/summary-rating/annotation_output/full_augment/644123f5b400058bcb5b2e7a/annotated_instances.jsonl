A substantial percentage of respondents express frustration with the expectation to tip for minor or no service, describing the culture as overkill and noting they feel pressured or bullied by the prevalence of tipping prompts.</p>\n<p>A large majority of comments advocate for a fundamental shift where employers pay a living wage, thereby reducing or eliminating workers' reliance on tips. Many suggest this would allow tipping to return to its original purpose: a voluntary gesture of gratitude for exceptional service, rather than a mandatory subsidy for low wages.</p>\n<p>There is notable support for integrating a service charge into the bill to replace tipping, mirroring systems in other countries like those in Europe.
