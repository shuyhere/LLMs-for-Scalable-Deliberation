My reason is that, in times of a severe epidemic, protecting public health and saving lives may need strong actions. Individual freedom is important, but the danger of uncontrolled disease spread can hurt many more people. When the government enforces measures like vaccination and quarantine, it can help stop the outbreak more quickly and safeguard vulnerable populations."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 52s "}}
