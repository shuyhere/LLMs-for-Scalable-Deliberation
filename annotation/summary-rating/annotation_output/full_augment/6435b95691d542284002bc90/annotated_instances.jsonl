They use it to streamline daily routines, automate tedious tasks, summarize large amounts of information quickly, and refine work like letters and proposals. This automation is often credited with saving time and creating more freedom for other activities.</p>\n<p>Beyond general productivity, AI is valued as a tool for learning and creativity. Some use it as a \"tutor\" to understand complex subjects, improve their writing skills, or learn technical information. Others leverage it for creative pursuits, such as generating ideas, assisting with digital art, or helping to visualize concepts. For some, it has been particularly helpful for professional development, assisting with resumes and emails.</p>\n<p>However, the comments also reveal significant concerns and negative consequences. A primary concern revolves around privacy, with individuals expressing worry about their personal data being collected and tracked without their knowledge, describing it as a \"major intrusion.\" Another prominent negative sentiment is a growing sense of distrust and anxiety. Some feel \"hyper aware\" and vigilant, trying to spot AI-generated content in creative fields, which they sometimes view as \"theft.\"</p>\n<p>Fears about potential job losses due to AI were also mentioned. Additionally, some pointed out the limitations of the technology, noting that the information it provides can be inaccurate or biased, requiring users to fact-check its outputs.</p>\n<p>Finally, a smaller group of respondents feel that AI has not significantly changed their lives.
