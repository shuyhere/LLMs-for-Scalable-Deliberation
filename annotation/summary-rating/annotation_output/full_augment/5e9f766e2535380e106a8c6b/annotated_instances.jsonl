A significant portion of the comments express concern that the policy will have a <strong>negative impact</strong>, citing increased prices for consumers, harm to small businesses, and economic uncertainty. Many argue that the cost of tariffs is ultimately passed on to everyday Americans, exacerbating financial strain, especially for those already struggling. Others highlight the potential for trade tensions and damaged international relationships, which could undermine long-term economic stability and global competitiveness.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller but notable share of the comments view the tariff policy as a <strong>positive step</strong> for the U.S. economy. Supporters argue that it helps balance trade relationships, generates revenue, and could lead to long-term benefits such as job creation and economic stabilization. Some believe that while there may be short-term challenges, the policy aligns with broader goals of revitalizing domestic industries and reducing economic inequality.</p>\n<p>A number of comments acknowledge a <strong>mixed or uncertain impact</strong>, noting that while certain industries may benefit, others could suffer. Some suggest that the policy may not be as effective as intended due to companies finding ways to circumvent tariffs or due to the complexity of global supply chains.</p>\n<p>Overall, the sentiment leans toward concern about the short-term negative consequences of the tariff policy, with a more cautious or optimistic outlook on its long-term potential.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
