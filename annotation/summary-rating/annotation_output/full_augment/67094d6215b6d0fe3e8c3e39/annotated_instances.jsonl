There is strong support for making tipping optional, clearly presented as such at checkout (with an easy \u201cno tip\u201d option), and tied to the quality of service rather than an expectation in every interaction.</p>\n<p>A dominant theme is shifting responsibility back to employers: paying a fair, livable wage (at least full minimum wage for tipped workers) so workers don\u2019t have to rely on tips for basic income. Numerous commenters favor eliminating or reducing tipping by raising menu prices, integrating a standard service charge into the bill (often cited around 10%), or adopting European-style systems where gratuity is included and tips are rare bonuses. Others see tipping as a necessary stopgap until wages rise, while a smaller group strongly endorses tipping as an incentive (often 20%+), with a few suggesting fixed-dollar tips rather than percentages or even mandatory tips in limited cases.</p>\n<p>Common ground across viewpoints includes: tipping should reward good or exceptional service; customers shouldn\u2019t be pressured; counter-service and simple transactions generally shouldn\u2019t solicit tips; and workers deserve predictable, fair pay. Additional, less frequent suggestions include reducing suggested tip percentages, ensuring tips are untaxed, employers matching a portion of tips, or offering small acknowledgments (thank-you notes/coupons) when tips are given.</p>\n<p>In short, most want a system that ensures stable, livable wages for workers and restores tipping to a voluntary, service-based bonus\u2014while curbing intrusive prompts and limiting who is tipped to contexts where meaningful service is provided.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
