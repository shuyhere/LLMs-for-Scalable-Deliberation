A majority of comments express frustration with \"tipping creep,\" where customers feel pressured to tip in situations that traditionally did not require it, such as for counter service, pickup orders, or transactions with minimal human interaction. This expansion is often attributed to modern point-of-sale tablet systems that prompt for a tip by default.</p>\n<p>The most prevalent theme is that the tipping system allows employers to underpay their staff, shifting the responsibility of providing a livable wage from the business to the consumer. Consequently, the most frequently proposed solution is to abolish the current tipping system entirely. This is almost always paired with the demand that businesses be required to pay their employees a fair, livable wage, even if it means raising menu prices to cover the increased labor costs.</p>\n<p>While many wish to eliminate the current obligatory nature of tipping, there is a common belief that tipping should return to its original purpose: a voluntary and optional gesture of gratitude for exceptional service. It should be earned, not expected.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of participants suggested alternative systems, such as replacing tipping with a mandatory, fixed-percentage service charge, similar to practices in other countries, or standardizing tips to fixed dollar amounts rather than percentages. A minority expressed positive views on tipping, seeing it as a good incentive for workers to provide excellent service or as a necessary way to support underpaid workers within the existing system.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
