Many cite the fundamental principle that people fleeing life-threatening situations deserve safety and protection. Supporters frequently reference America's historical identity as a nation built by immigrants and refugees, arguing that accepting those in need aligns with core American values of freedom, democracy, and compassion. Several respondents note that refugees often become productive, grateful citizens who contribute positively to society through increased diversity, economic activity, and cultural enrichment. Some also acknowledge America's role in global conflicts, suggesting a responsibility to help those displaced by wars in which the U.S. has been involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Those opposed to accepting more refugees</strong> primarily express concerns about domestic priorities and resource limitations. A recurring theme is that America should focus on helping its own citizens first, particularly given economic challenges, national debt, and existing struggles faced by Americans.
