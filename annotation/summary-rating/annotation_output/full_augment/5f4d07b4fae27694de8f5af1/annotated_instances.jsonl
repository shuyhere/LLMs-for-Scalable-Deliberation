The primary justification centers on the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right and a necessity, not a luxury, and that access should not be dependent on income or employment status. Many commenters expressed frustration with the current private, for-profit system, citing prohibitive costs, medical debt, and denied care as critical failures. There is a strong sentiment that a government system would lead to better public health outcomes through an emphasis on preventative care and would be more equitable.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the comparison to other developed nations, where universal healthcare systems are seen as both successful and a standard that the U.S. fails to meet. Some supporters framed the issue as a matter of national duty, economic competitiveness, and even national security.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of comments expressed opposition, primarily over concerns about government inefficiency, high costs to taxpayers, and a general preference for private sector solutions. A few others offered conditional or partial support, advocating for a system that includes a public option alongside private insurance or expressing concerns that any plan must ensure care is administered in a timely manner to be effective.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
