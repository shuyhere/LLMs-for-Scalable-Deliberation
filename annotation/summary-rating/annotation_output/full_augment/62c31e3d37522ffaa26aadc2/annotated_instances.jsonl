Many feel that businesses should be required to pay their staff a livable base wage, which would remove the employees' dependency on tips for their income. This shifts the financial responsibility from the customer back to the employer. Consequently, many advocate for an end to mandatory or forced tipping, viewing tips as something that should be an optional reward for good service rather than an obligation.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improving the system varied. Some propose eliminating tipping altogether. Others suggest creative changes, such as moving from a percentage-based model to fixed-dollar amounts to ensure a more substantial tip. Another idea was to make tipping a reciprocal act, where the customer might receive a thank-you note or a future coupon in exchange for their generosity.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
