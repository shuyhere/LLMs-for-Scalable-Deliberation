Common complaints include the expansion of tipping requests to establishments that traditionally didn't ask for tips, such as counter service, pickup orders, and basic transactions.

Many respondents express frustration with the current system, particularly the expectation of tipping for minimal or no service, and the pressure it places on consumers. A significant portion of the feedback centers on the idea that tipping should be voluntary and tied directly to the quality of service, rather than being an assumed or mandatory part of the transaction.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the belief that the tipping system disproportionately shifts the responsibility of fair compensation from employers to consumers. Many argue that service workers should be paid a livable wage, and that tipping should not be a substitute for fair employment practices. Some suggest replacing the tipping system with a fixed service charge, as seen in other countries, to make the process more transparent and less burdensome for both customers and employees.</p>\n<p>While a number of respondents support tipping as a way to reward good service, they also emphasize that it should not be expected in all situations, such as for takeout or self-service. Others criticize the growing intrusion of tipping prompts in digital payment systems, which they view as manipulative and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>A few voices defend the tipping system, particularly when it is used voluntarily and as a means of showing appreciation for exceptional service. However, even among these supporters, there is a common call for better wages and working conditions for service workers, regardless of tipping.</p>\n<p>In summary, the feedback highlights a desire for a more ethical, transparent, and less coercive approach to tipping. Many believe the system should be reformed or replaced to ensure fair wages for workers and reduce the pressure on consumers to tip in situations where it is not warranted.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
