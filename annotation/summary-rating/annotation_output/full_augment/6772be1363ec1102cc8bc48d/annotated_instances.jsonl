The most prevalent argument is that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege, and should not be dependent on a person's income or employment status.</p>\n<p>Many supporters believe the current market-based system is failing, citing its prohibitive expense, lack of access, and poor outcomes. Commenters frequently expressed that people should not have to choose between medical care and other basic necessities or face a lifetime of medical debt. Several people pointed to other developed nations with universal healthcare as successful models the U.S. should emulate, viewing the country as lagging behind. The idea that a universal system would be more efficient, lead to a healthier populace, and improve economic competitiveness was also a common theme.</p>\n<p>While support is strong, some commenters provided conditions. A notable portion of supporters emphasized the importance of choice, advocating for a public option to exist alongside private insurance rather than as a complete replacement. Others stipulated that a government-run system must be able to provide care in a timely and efficient manner.</p>\n<p>A small percentage of commenters opposed the idea. Their reasons included a belief that the government is inherently inefficient and would provide lower-quality care than the private sector. They also expressed a philosophical objection to increasing dependency on the government.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
