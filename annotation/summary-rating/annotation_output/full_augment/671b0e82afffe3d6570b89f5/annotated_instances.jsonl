Supporters see it as a valid way to earn a living, often by pursuing a passion with flexibility and the potential for a good income. Commenters appreciate that influencers provide value to their audiences through entertainment, information, advice, and product recommendations. Some go as far as to call them the \"new media,\" comparing them to a more down-to-earth and accessible version of traditional celebrities and suggesting they can be a valuable source for news and cited information.</p>\n<p>However, there are also critical perspectives. A recurring negative theme is a perceived lack of genuineness, with some finding influencers to be annoying and inauthentic. Another criticism is the potential negative impact on culture, suggesting that by promoting trends, influencers may inadvertently discourage individuality and creativity, leading to conformity. One commenter also added a note of caution, expressing that while the profession is valid, it's important for influencers to remain authentic and responsible.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
