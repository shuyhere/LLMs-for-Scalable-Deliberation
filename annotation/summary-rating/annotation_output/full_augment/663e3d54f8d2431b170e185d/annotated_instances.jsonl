A majority of comments express frustration with the expectation to tip for minimal or no service, and many feel that the proliferation of digital payment systems has made tipping feel obligatory and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of commenters advocate for the elimination of tipping, arguing that employers should pay a living wage instead of relying on customers to subsidize employee income. This sentiment is often coupled with the belief that the responsibility for fair compensation should lie with the business, not the consumer.</p>\n<p>There is also a strong desire to return tipping to its original purpose: a voluntary reward for exceptional service. Many feel that tipping should be reserved for sit-down restaurants where full service is provided, rather than being requested at every transaction point. Some suggest alternative models, such as incorporating a standard service charge into the bill or moving to a fixed-amount system instead of percentages.</p>\n<p>While a minority of commenters support tipping as an incentive for good service or a way to show appreciation, even this group often expresses concern about the current culture. Overall, the prevailing opinion calls for systemic change to reduce consumer pressure and ensure fair wages for service workers.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
