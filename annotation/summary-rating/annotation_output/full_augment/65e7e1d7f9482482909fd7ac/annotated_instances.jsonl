About 70% oppose the cuts, around 20% express conditional or mixed views, and roughly 10% are neutral or say they need more details. No comments offer unqualified support.\n- Common reasons for opposition: Education seen as foundational to society; concerns about harming students (especially those with financial need) and educators; risks to research, innovation, and long-term national competitiveness; potential brain drain to other countries; worries about declining quality and safety in education; belief that investing in education yields greater long-term benefits.\n- Minority/conditional perspectives: Some cite perceived left-leaning bias in academia as partial justification for reductions, while still warning about negative consequences. One commenter trusts the administration may have reasons but stresses the need for alternatives to avoid degrading educational quality.\n- Tone and implications: The tone is often strongly critical, describing the policy as short-sighted and harmful, with fears of broader societal decline if education is defunded.\n- Implicit recommendations: Maintain or increase investment in education and research; if any cuts occur, pair them with clear alternative solutions to prevent harm to access, quality, and innovation.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
