A central and frequently repeated theme is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury or privilege that should be tied to income or employment status.</p>\n<p>Many participants describe the current system as prohibitively expensive, leading to medical debt, bankruptcy, and forcing individuals to choose between necessary care and other basic needs like food and rent. Frequent comparisons are made to other developed nations that provide universal healthcare, with many expressing that the U.S. is lagging behind. The responsibility of a wealthy government to care for its citizens' well-being is also a common justification. Supporters believe a government-provided system would lead to better public health outcomes by increasing access to preventative care, enabling earlier diagnosis of diseases, and creating a healthier, more economically competitive workforce.</p>\n<p>While support is widespread, some comments include specific conditions. A portion of supporters advocate for a public option to exist alongside private insurance to preserve consumer choice. Others express their support is contingent on the system being efficient and avoiding long wait times for care.</p>\n<p>A minority of comments oppose the idea. Reasons for opposition include concerns about government inefficiency, wastefulness, and the potential for a decline in the quality of care. Some fear it would lead to higher taxes, longer wait times, and an increased dependency on the government. The fairness of taxpayers funding care for those who do not contribute to the system was also raised as a concern.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
