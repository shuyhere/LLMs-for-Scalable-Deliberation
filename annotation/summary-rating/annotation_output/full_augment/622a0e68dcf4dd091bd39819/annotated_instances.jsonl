A common theme is the feeling of \"tipping fatigue,\" with frustration expressed over being asked for tips for every small transaction and through pop-up menus on payment screens. Some feel pressured or even bullied into tipping, particularly when it is mandatory or implied for minimal service.</p>\n<p>The most frequently suggested solution is for businesses to pay their employees a livable wage. This would shift the responsibility from the customer to the employer, ensuring that workers do not have to rely on the variability of tips to make a living. In this context, many believe tipping should return to its original purpose: a voluntary reward for excellent service, not an obligation.</p>\n<p>Other specific ideas for reform include getting rid of the tipping system entirely, changing the standard from percentages to fixed amounts, or even having the business provide a small token of appreciation, like a coupon, in exchange for a tip.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
