A sizable minority emphasize individual rights and bodily autonomy.\n- Support for enforcement:\n  - Around 55\u201360% favor allowing governments to enforce both vaccination and quarantine, often citing herd immunity, the \u201cgreater good,\u201d faster epidemic control, and lessons from COVID-19.\n  - About 15\u201320% support enforcing quarantine but oppose compulsory vaccination, preferring voluntary vaccination or access rules set by institutions rather than state mandates.\n  - Roughly 20\u201325% oppose government enforcement altogether, citing constitutional limits, bodily autonomy, distrust of government, and concerns about rushed or unsafe vaccines.\n- Common conditions among supporters: Measures should be limited to truly severe outbreaks, time-bound, evidence-driven, and based on vaccines that are proven safe and effective (e.g., FDA-approved). Many call for clear public communication, transparency about risks and benefits, and free, accessible vaccination. Medical exemptions are frequently implied or stated.\n- Enforcement preferences and concerns: Some endorse penalties or restrictions for noncompliance; others favor education and persuasion over coercion. Equity concerns appear (e.g., avoid cost barriers). Several want measures scaled back as more becomes known about a disease.\n- Key themes: Public health vs. civil liberties; trust in government and science; mixed assessments of COVID-era policies and messaging; the need to balance collective safety with personal choice.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
