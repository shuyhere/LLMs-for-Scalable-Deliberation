Many call for clear public communication, transparency about risks and benefits, and free, accessible vaccination. Medical exemptions are frequently implied or stated.\n- Enforcement preferences and concerns: Some endorse penalties or restrictions for noncompliance; others favor education and persuasion over coercion.
