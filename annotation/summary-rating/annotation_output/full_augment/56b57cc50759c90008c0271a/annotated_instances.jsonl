Most in this group cite protecting public health, herd immunity, safeguarding vulnerable people, and the \u201cgreater good.\u201d Many want guardrails: trigger only in severe outbreaks, base decisions on clear scientific evidence and proven safety/efficacy (e.g., FDA approval), ensure transparency and public education, make vaccines free and accessible, include medical exemptions, and add sunset clauses.</li>\n<li>Oppose both mandates: about 19%. Common reasons include bodily autonomy, constitutional/rights concerns, distrust of government competence and transparency during COVID, fear of abuse of power, and worries about side effects or rushed development.</li>\n<li>Support quarantine mandates but oppose vaccine mandates: about 12%. This group accepts enforced isolation to protect others but views vaccination as a personal medical decision, at least until long-term data are available.</li>\n<li>Oppose vaccine mandates (quarantine stance unspecified): about 10%. Themes mirror autonomy and safety concerns; some emphasize choice and informed consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional nuances</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional support was common even among supporters: early, severe phases justify mandates; measures should be lifted as risk declines.</li>\n<li>Enforcement ideas ranged from education and incentives to fines, work or access restrictions, and marking vaccination status; others strongly rejected punitive approaches.</li>\n<li>Trust and communication matter: several called for clearer risk communication, depoliticization, and transparency about ingredients, trials, and side effects.</li>\n<li>Equity concerns appeared: mandates should avoid creating financial or access barriers; free provision was seen as important.</li>\n<li>Ethical tradeoff: many framed the issue as balancing individual liberty with collective safety, with disagreements centered on where to draw that line.</li>\n</ul>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
