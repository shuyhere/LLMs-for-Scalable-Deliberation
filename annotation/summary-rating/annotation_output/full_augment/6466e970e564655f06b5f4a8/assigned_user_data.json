Many express a willingness to pay higher menu prices if it means tipping is no longer necessary and workers receive a stable income.</p>\n<p>Several key themes emerged from the comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tip Creep and Fatigue:</strong> Participants are frustrated with the expansion of tipping requests to environments where it was not previously expected, such as for counter service, pickup orders, and drive-thrus. The proliferation of digital payment tablets that prompt for tips is a common source of irritation, creating pressure and awkwardness.</li>\n<li><strong>Tipping Should be for Service:</strong> A strong sentiment is that tips should be a voluntary reward for excellent and substantial service, not an obligation for minimal interaction or poor performance. Many feel the connection between service quality and tipping has been lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflicted Feelings:</strong> While disliking the system, many people still tip generously out of a sense of obligation and empathy for underpaid workers.
