Participants worried about declining education quality, reduced resources for learning, and limited access to higher education.</p>\n<p><strong>Research and Innovation</strong>\nA significant portion of comments highlighted concerns about halting critical research, particularly in medical fields like cancer research. Respondents feared that cutting research funding would drive talented researchers to other countries, weakening America's competitive position in science and innovation. The potential loss of billions in economic benefits from research breakthroughs was also mentioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term Societal Effects</strong>\nMany participants viewed the cuts as short-sighted, predicting negative consequences for America's future workforce and economic competitiveness. Several suggested the cuts would create skill gaps, reduce social mobility, and leave the country unable to compete globally.

Supporters cited concerns about perceived political bias in academic institutions, inefficient government spending on education, and misuse of funds by school boards.
