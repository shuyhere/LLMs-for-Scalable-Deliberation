Many argue that the current system allows businesses to underpay employees and shifts the financial responsibility onto customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Criticism of Mandatory or Forced Tipping:</strong><br />\n   Several commenters are critical of the increasing prevalence of mandatory or suggested tipping, particularly in situations where direct service is minimal or nonexistent (e.g., drive-thru, pickup orders, or retail). They find it uncomfortable or unfair to be pressured into tipping in these contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Tipping as a Reward for Service:</strong><br />\n   Many commenters support tipping as a way to reward good service, but emphasize that it should be optional and based on the quality of service provided. They believe tipping should reflect appreciation, not be a social obligation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suggestions for Reform:</strong><br />\n   Proposals for improving the system include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Eliminating the tipping system entirely and replacing it with a service charge.</li>\n<li>Setting fixed tipping amounts rather than percentages.</li>\n<li>Ensuring a standard tipping structure based on the type of service.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adopting models from other countries, such as a flat service fee included in the bill.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Discomfort with Tipping Culture:</strong><br />\n   A number of commenters express discomfort with the growing expectation of tipping in many aspects of daily life. They argue that tipping has become over-expected, confusing, and even intrusive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for Tipping in Certain Contexts:</strong><br />\n   Some commenters believe tipping is appropriate in specific situations, such as in sit-down restaurants or for delivery services. They support tipping as a way to show gratitude for good service but oppose it in scenarios where direct service is minimal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Calls for Voluntary Tipping:</strong><br />\n   Many argue that tipping should remain voluntary and that businesses should not manipulate or pressure customers into tipping through default prompts or hidden fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, while some commenters support tipping as a means of rewarding good service, a strong consensus emerges in favor of reforming the system. The most common recommendations include eliminating the tipping system in favor of fair wages, reducing the pressure on consumers to tip, and ensuring that tipping is optional and tied to the quality of service.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
