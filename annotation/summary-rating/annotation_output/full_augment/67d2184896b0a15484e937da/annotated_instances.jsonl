Some stress that vaccines should be free to avoid inequities.\n- Enforcement preferences vary: a few endorse strict penalties and work restrictions for non-compliance, while others favor education, encouragement, and voluntary uptake.\n- COVID-19 is a dominant reference point, used both to justify mandates (as effective and necessary) and to argue against them (perceived poor government performance, mixed messaging, and safety concerns).\n- Cross-cutting themes include the balance between individual rights and collective safety, the importance of evidence-based thresholds and sunset clauses, and the need for trust-building through transparency and public sensitization.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
