A central theme is the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury, and that no one should be denied care or die because they cannot afford it.</p>\n<p>Participants view the current market-based system as a failure, criticizing it for being excessively expensive, providing limited access, and yielding poor health outcomes. In contrast, a government-provided system is seen as a way to make healthcare more efficient and affordable, particularly by ensuring everyone participates.</p>\n<p>The rationale for government involvement extends to economic and security concerns. Some argue that a healthy population is essential for the United States to remain competitive in the global economy, framing universal healthcare as a national security issue. Commenters also point to other developed nations as successful examples of government-run healthcare systems. While the support is clear, there is a nuance that a government plan should exist as an option, not necessarily as the only choice available.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
