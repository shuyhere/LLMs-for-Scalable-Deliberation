Several noted that AI serves as a valuable assistant for professional tasks such as writing emails, creating resumes, and perfecting proposals.</p>\n<h6>Information Access and Learning</h6>\n<p>Many participants emphasized AI's role in transforming how they access and process information. Several compared AI tools like ChatGPT to an improved version of traditional search engines, providing quick summaries and relevant sources.

Some participants celebrated AI's ability to help with artistic expression, image editing, and generating new ideas for projects like home remodeling. Others used AI for personal growth, such as improving writing skills or helping navigate interpersonal conflicts. However, a subset of respondents expressed strong negative feelings about AI in creative fields, viewing it as theft and causing anxiety about authenticity in art and writing.</p>\n<h6>Privacy and Trust Concerns</h6>\n<p>Privacy emerged as a significant concern among participants. Several expressed worry about AI systems collecting and tracking personal data without explicit consent. This data collection has led some to feel their privacy has been invaded, creating distrust and vigilance about AI usage. Some participants reported becoming hyperaware of AI-generated content and actively trying to avoid it.</p>\n<h6>Varied Levels of Impact</h6>\n<p>While many participants reported transformative changes, others noted minimal impact on their lives.
