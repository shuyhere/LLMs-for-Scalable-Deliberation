They argue that in a wealthy, developed nation, no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities like food or shelter. Many express that it's the government's fundamental responsibility to ensure the health and wellbeing of its citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nRespondents frequently reference other developed countries that successfully provide universal healthcare, expressing frustration that the United States lags behind.

They argue that universal coverage would be more cost-effective overall, reducing emergency care costs through preventive services and eliminating the inefficiencies of the current system. Some point out that despite spending more on healthcare than other nations, the U.S. has poorer health outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Benefits</strong>\nMany emphasize how universal coverage would improve public health through better access to preventive care, early disease detection, and timely treatment.
