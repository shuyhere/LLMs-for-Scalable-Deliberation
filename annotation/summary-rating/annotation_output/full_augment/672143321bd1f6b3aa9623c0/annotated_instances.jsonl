They argue that real-name registration would <strong>reduce cyberbullying, misinformation, and impersonation</strong>, particularly by <strong>bots or malicious actors</strong>. Some emphasize the <strong>protection of minors</strong> and the <strong>prevention of scams and fraud</strong>, noting that verified identities can make investigations easier in the event of harm.

Several suggest platform-led or optional approaches as a compromise.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
