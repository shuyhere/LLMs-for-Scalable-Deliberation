Most in this group cite protecting public health, herd immunity, safeguarding vulnerable people, and the \u201cgreater good.\u201d Many want guardrails: trigger only in severe outbreaks, base decisions on clear scientific evidence and proven safety/efficacy (e.g., FDA approval), ensure transparency and public education, make vaccines free and accessible, include medical exemptions, and add sunset clauses.</li>\n<li>Oppose both mandates: about 19%. Common reasons include bodily autonomy, constitutional/rights concerns, distrust of government competence and transparency during COVID, fear of abuse of power, and worries about side effects or rushed development.</li>\n<li>Support quarantine mandates but oppose vaccine mandates: about 12%. This group accepts enforced isolation to protect others but views vaccination as a personal medical decision, at least until long-term data are available.</li>\n<li>Oppose vaccine mandates (quarantine stance unspecified): about 10%.
