A majority of comments express support for government enforcement, citing public health protection, pandemic prevention, and collective responsibility as key reasons. Supporters emphasize that mandates are necessary to control disease spread and protect communities, particularly during uncertain phases of a pandemic.</p>\n<p>A smaller portion of comments opposes enforcement, primarily due to concerns about personal freedom, differing beliefs, and potential negative health effects from vaccines developed rapidly. Some also express skepticism about the effectiveness of enforcement, suggesting people will ultimately make their own choices. The discussion highlights tensions between individual rights and public health priorities.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
