Many feel tipping should reward good service rather than be expected or mandatory, and several would prefer moving toward a system where workers receive a livable base wage so tips are supplementary or unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Key themes and suggested changes:\n- Reduce pressure and scope: Strong support for ending mandatory or implied tipping, removing aggressive tip prompts, and limiting tipping to genuine service rather than counter service or pickup.\n- Pay structure reform: Frequent calls for employers to pay a livable wage, with some favoring European-style models, integrating service into menu prices, or adding a modest service charge while making tipping optional.\n- Standardization and clarity: Ideas include setting clearer, non-manipulative guidelines, switching from percentage-based tips to fixed amounts, or establishing standard tipping tiers by purchase level to protect consumers\u2019 budgets.\n- Incentives and reciprocity: A few propose small tokens in return for tips (e.g., thank-you notes or coupons) to acknowledge appreciation.\n- Divergent views: A minority argues for higher or more consistent tipping (or even compelling it) to support low-wage workers, while another subset would abolish tipping altogether in favor of built-in service charges or fully inclusive pricing.</p>\n<p>Underlying rationales include fairness to workers, transparency in pricing, reducing social coercion, rewarding service quality, and addressing customer affordability.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
