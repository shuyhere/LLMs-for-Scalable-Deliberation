The dominant sentiment is that the system is broken and has strayed far from its original purpose of rewarding good service.</p>\n<p>A significant majority of comments express the view that tipping has evolved from a voluntary reward into a pressured, obligatory subsidy for low wages. The most frequently cited problem is that businesses are able to pay employees, especially in the food service industry, less than a livable wage, shifting the responsibility of fair compensation onto the customer. Consequently, the most popular proposed solution is to abolish the current tipping system and require employers to pay all workers a fair, livable wage. This would return tipping to its intended status as a truly optional bonus for exceptional service.</p>\n<p>Many participants voiced frustration with \"tip creep\"\u2014the expansion of tipping requests to transactions involving minimal or no direct service, such as picking up takeout orders or paying at a counter. The proliferation of tablet point-of-sale systems that prompt for a tip on every transaction was a common source of annoyance, with many feeling that these systems create an uncomfortable and pressured social obligation.</p>\n<p>While the negative view is prevalent, a smaller percentage of participants support tipping, viewing it as a good way to show appreciation, incentivize excellent service, and directly help workers. Some of these individuals consistently tip generously.</p>\n<p>Other suggested improvements include:\n*   Replacing tipping with a mandatory, fixed service charge, similar to systems in Europe or Japan.\n*   Making tipping strictly voluntary and based on the quality of service received.\n*   Limiting tipping requests to specific roles, such as sit-down restaurant servers and delivery drivers.\n*   Changing the default options on payment tablets to make \"no tip\" an easier, less awkward choice.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
