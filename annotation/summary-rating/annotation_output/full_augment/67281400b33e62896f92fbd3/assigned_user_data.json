They argue that people should not face death or suffering due to financial constraints, and that providing healthcare aligns with government's core purpose of protecting citizens' safety and wellbeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>\nParticipants highlight multiple economic advantages of universal healthcare. They note that a government system would be more cost-effective overall compared to private care, creating efficiency through universal participation. Additionally, some view healthcare as crucial for maintaining American competitiveness in the global economy, framing it as both an economic necessity and a national security issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Current System Failures</strong>\nRespondents express strong dissatisfaction with the existing healthcare system, citing prohibitive costs, limited access, and poor health outcomes despite high expenses. They argue that the open market has failed to provide adequate healthcare as a social good, leaving many without coverage due to unemployment or inability to afford insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>International Comparisons</strong>\nSeveral comments reference other countries' successful implementation of universal healthcare, particularly Canada's system.
