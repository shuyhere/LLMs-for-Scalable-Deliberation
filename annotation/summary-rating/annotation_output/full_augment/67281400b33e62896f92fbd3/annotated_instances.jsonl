A common theme was the belief that healthcare is a fundamental human right and a necessity, not a privilege. Many emphasized that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to ensure equitable access to healthcare, especially for those who cannot afford it. Supporters often cited the success of universal healthcare systems in other developed countries and pointed out the inefficiencies and high costs of the current private insurance model in the U.S.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the feedback highlighted the moral and economic benefits of universal healthcare, such as reducing medical debt, improving public health outcomes, and increasing access to preventive care. Some supported a public option alongside private insurance to preserve choice while ensuring coverage for all. Concerns were also raised about the current system\u2019s failure to provide adequate care for low-income individuals and the moral implications of allowing people to suffer or die due to unaffordable care.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a smaller percentage of comments opposed government-provided healthcare. Opponents argued that the government is inefficient at managing services, that it would be too costly, and that it could lead to waste or reduced quality of care. Some also expressed concerns about increased taxation or a loss of personal choice in healthcare options.</p>\n<p>A few comments suggested a middle ground, supporting basic government-provided healthcare but emphasizing the need for efficiency, accessibility, and timely care. Overall, the sentiment was largely in favor of expanding government involvement in healthcare to ensure that all individuals, regardless of income, have access to essential medical services.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
