Many argued that the current market-based system fails to ensure access, affordability, and quality, particularly for low-income individuals and those with chronic or complex health conditions. Supporters highlighted the moral obligation of the government to care for its citizens, the potential cost savings through universal coverage, and the success of similar systems in other countries as evidence for the feasibility of such a model.</p>\n<p>Some comments advocated for a public option alongside private insurance, emphasizing the importance of choice while ensuring that all individuals have access to basic care. Others raised concerns about the efficiency and quality of government-run systems, with a few opposing government involvement altogether, citing a preference for private sector solutions and skepticism about government performance.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme among supporters was the belief that denying healthcare based on financial ability is both unethical and detrimental to societal well-being. Concerns were also raised about long wait times and the need for timely access to care in a government-run system. Overall, the discussion reflected a strong consensus that the current system is inadequate and that a government-led approach could better serve the public interest.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
