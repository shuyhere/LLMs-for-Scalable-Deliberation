A smaller portion (around 21%) view the policy positively, while a few others see mixed or negligible effects.</p>\n<p>The primary concern among those with a negative view is the direct impact on American consumers. Many comments stated that companies would pass the cost of tariffs on to customers, leading to higher prices for everyday goods, increased inflation, and reduced consumer spending. Additional negative consequences cited include damaging international trade relationships, particularly with China; harming small businesses; and failing to reshore manufacturing jobs as intended. Some also criticized the policy as being poorly conceived and disruptive to the global economy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, supporters of the tariff policy believe it will yield positive results, particularly in the long term. Arguments in favor suggest that the tariffs correct unfair trade imbalances where other countries were paying too little. Some believe this policy will help stabilize the economy, raise federal revenue, and ultimately lift Americans out of poverty by encouraging the purchase of American-made goods. Several comments noted that while there might be short-term negative issues, the long-run benefits would be substantial.</p>\n<p>A few comments offered a more nuanced or neutral perspective, suggesting the policy has mixed effects\u2014protecting some domestic industries while hurting consumers\u2014or that it might be largely ineffective as companies find ways to circumvent the tariffs.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
