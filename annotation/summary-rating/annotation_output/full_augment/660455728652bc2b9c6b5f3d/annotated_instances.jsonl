A majority of contributors express frustration with the pressure to tip for every small transaction and at establishments where it feels inappropriate. There is overwhelming support for the idea that businesses, particularly restaurants, should be responsible for paying their employees a livable base wage, eliminating their heavy reliance on customer tips. Many feel that tipping should be reserved for rewarding exceptional service and should never be mandatory or expected for minimal or no service.</p>\n<p>Suggestions for improvement include shifting from a percentage-based system to fixed-amount tipping and providing customers with small tokens of appreciation, like thank you notes or coupons, for their tips. A minority of contributors support the current system, viewing tips as a beneficial way to show appreciation for service, but still acknowledge the financial strain it can place on customers. Overall, the sentiment calls for a fundamental shift in responsibility from the customer to the employer to ensure worker welfare.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
