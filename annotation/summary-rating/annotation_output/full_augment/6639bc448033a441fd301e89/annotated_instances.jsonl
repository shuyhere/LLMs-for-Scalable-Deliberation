They frequently cite immediate price increases for consumers and everyday goods, arguing that these costs are ultimately passed on to households, making living expenses more burdensome. Some also worry about the strain on international trade relationships, suggesting that other countries may seek alternative trading partners, potentially isolating the U.S. There is a recurring theme that the policy may primarily benefit wealthy interests or specific industries while harming small businesses and the broader population. A few comments also mention that the policy creates uncertainty and could tarnish the U.S.'s reputation as a stable trading partner.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commentators believe the tariffs will have a positive effect, particularly in the long term. Supporters argue that the policy will help stabilize the economy by generating revenue and reducing national debt. They express confidence that it will protect domestic industries, bring jobs back to the U.S., and encourage consumers to buy American-made products, leading to greater economic independence and strength. Some acknowledge potential short-term challenges but feel these will be outweighed by future benefits.</p>\n<p>Overall, the deliberation reflects a tension between immediate negative effects, such as higher costs and economic uncertainty, and the anticipated long-term gains in economic stability and self-sufficiency.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
