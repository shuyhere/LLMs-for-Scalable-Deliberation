Some also believe the government has a fundamental duty to protect its citizens during a public health crisis.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a slightly larger group of commenters oppose government enforcement, particularly regarding mandatory vaccinations. The core of this opposition is rooted in principles of bodily autonomy and individual choice, with many stating that people should have the final say over their own health decisions. Concerns about the safety and rapid development of vaccines, citing potential side effects and insufficient long-term data, were frequently mentioned. A general distrust of the government, stemming from a perceived lack of transparency or poor handling of past crises, also fueled this opposition.</p>\n<p>A number of commenters took a more nuanced stance. Some distinguished between the two measures, supporting mandatory quarantine but rejecting forced vaccinations. Others suggested that such powers should only be used in truly severe situations and only if the vaccines are proven to be safe and effective. Another perspective advocated for strong encouragement of these measures rather than enforcement.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
