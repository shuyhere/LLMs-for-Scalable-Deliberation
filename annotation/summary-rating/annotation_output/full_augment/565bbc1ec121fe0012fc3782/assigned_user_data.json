Many note that companies are passing tariff costs directly to consumers, resulting in higher prices for everyday goods and essential items.

They believe the tariffs will eventually encourage domestic production, create jobs, and generate revenue that will help reduce national debt. However, critics argue that reshoring manufacturing is extremely difficult given the dismantled supply chains and infrastructure, making these long-term goals unrealistic.</p>\n<h3>Implementation and Effectiveness</h3>\n<p>Several respondents question the effectiveness of the current approach, with some noting that companies are finding ways to circumvent the tariffs.
