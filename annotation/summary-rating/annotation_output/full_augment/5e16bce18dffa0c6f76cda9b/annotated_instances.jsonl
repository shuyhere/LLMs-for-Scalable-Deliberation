Roughly 80\u201385% were supportive (including conditional support), while about 15\u201320% were opposed.\n- Reasons for support: Humanitarian duty, empathy for those facing life-threatening situations, protection of human rights, alignment with national values and history, potential cultural and economic benefits, and a sense of responsibility when U.S. foreign policy contributes to crises. Some saw opportunities to bolster rural communities through resettlement and skills training.\n- Common conditions and implementation ideas: Rigorous vetting and background checks; clear criteria distinguishing refugees from economic migrants; exclusion of individuals with criminal histories; limits or quotas to manage capacity; ensuring assistance does not reduce citizens\u2019 quality of life; prioritizing vulnerable groups (e.g., children and families); orientation on laws and norms; stronger integration and workforce programs; geographic strategies to avoid overcrowding in cities; monitoring economic impacts and adjusting intake accordingly.\n- Reasons for opposition: Concerns about national debt and the ability to care for citizens first; perceived strain on public services and budgets; fears of long-term cost growth and population pressure; and frustration over perceived inequities between aid for refugees versus struggling citizens, sometimes conflating refugee admissions with illegal immigration.\n- Points of convergence: Even among supporters, there is broad agreement on the need for careful vetting, clear eligibility standards, resource planning, and balancing compassion with domestic capacity. Opponents\u2019 concerns center on safeguarding resources and prioritizing citizens, which overlap with supporters\u2019 calls for limits and impact monitoring.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?
