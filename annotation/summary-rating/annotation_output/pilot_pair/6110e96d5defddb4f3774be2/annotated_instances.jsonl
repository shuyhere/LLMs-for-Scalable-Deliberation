The majority of participants oppose this measure, citing several key concerns:</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy and Freedom Concerns</strong>: Many emphasize the importance of online anonymity as a fundamental freedom. Participants value the ability to express themselves without their real identity attached, particularly for discussing sensitive topics or engaging in open discourse without personal consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Security and Misuse</strong>: A significant concern involves how companies would handle personal information. Participants worry about databases of real identities being sold to third parties or government entities, potentially leading to surveillance or even arrests based on online activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional and Social Risks</strong>: Several participants fear real-world repercussions for their online expressions, particularly regarding political beliefs. The concern about job loss due to expressing certain viewpoints (notably mentioned for left-leaning positions like supporting free healthcare) was specifically highlighted.</p>\n<p><strong>Support for Real Identity Requirements</strong>: A minority of participants support the measure, primarily citing increased accountability and the potential reduction in cyberbullying and scams. These supporters believe that attaching real identities to online behavior would encourage more responsible conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Acceptance</strong>: Some participants distinguish between platform-initiated requirements versus government mandates, showing more openness to the former while strongly opposing the latter.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Concerns</strong>: Beyond philosophical objections, participants note enforcement challenges, suggesting that verification would require intrusive documentation that many find unacceptable.</p>\n<p>The comments reflect a tension between desires for online safety and accountability versus concerns about privacy, freedom of expression, and potential misuse of personal data.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 40s "}}
