The most prominent concerns revolve around privacy, safety, and freedom. Many believe that requiring real identities is an invasion of privacy, giving tech companies and potentially governments access to personal data that could be misused, sold, or leaked in data breaches.</p>\n<p>Several participants highlighted significant safety risks, arguing that anonymity protects vulnerable individuals, such as victims of domestic abuse seeking help or people with unpopular political views who fear real-world repercussions like job loss or harassment. Some also suggested that knowing a person's real identity could even escalate cyberbullying and lead to real-world stalking or violence. The freedom to be anonymous online was frequently cited as an important right, allowing for open expression without personal attachment.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a notable percentage of commenters support real-name registration, primarily because they believe it would increase accountability and improve user behavior. Supporters argue that linking online actions to real identities would deter negative activities like cyberbullying, harassment, scams, identity theft, and catfishing. The core belief is that people would act more responsibly and civilly if they could not hide behind an anonymous profile, leading to safer online communities.</p>\n<p>A third group of commenters offered a more nuanced or conditional perspective. Some suggested hybrid models, such as requiring real-name verification on the back end for the platform's use while still allowing users to post publicly under a pseudonym. Another proposed solution was to make identity verification optional, rewarding verified users with a badge (like a checkmark) to build trust without forcing it on everyone. Others felt their support depended on who was mandating the requirement\u2014a platform's policy might be acceptable, whereas a government mandate would not be.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_5": "5"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_5": "5"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 11s "}}
