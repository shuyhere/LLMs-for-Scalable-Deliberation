The majority of respondents oppose this measure, citing various concerns about privacy, freedom, and potential misuse of personal data.</p>\n<h6>Primary Concerns Against Real Identity Requirements</h6>\n<p>Privacy protection emerges as a central theme, with respondents emphasizing the importance of online anonymity.
