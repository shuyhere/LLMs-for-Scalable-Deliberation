Many express fear that such a requirement would be intrusive, could lead to data misuse by companies or governments, and might result in persecution for holding unpopular opinions. A significant portion values the freedom and safety that anonymity provides for open discussion.</p>\n<p>A minority supports the idea, primarily for the potential to increase accountability and reduce negative behaviors like cyberbullying and scams. Some supporters acknowledge the benefits of anonymity but feel that for mainstream social media, real identities could be a net positive.</p>\n<p>There is also a conditional perspective, where support depends on who mandates the policy, with a preference for platform-level rather than government-level requirements. Overall, the comments reflect a tension between the desire for a more accountable online environment and the protection of fundamental freedoms and privacy.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_4": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 36s "}}
