Concerns include companies selling information to governments or third parties, data breaches exposing personal information, and general erosion of online privacy rights.</p>\n<p><strong>Safety Concerns</strong>: Several respondents highlight risks to vulnerable populations, including:\n- Victims of domestic abuse seeking support online\n- People facing political persecution or job loss for expressing certain views\n- Increased vulnerability to cyberbullying, stalking, and harassment\n- Risk of real-world violence or fraud</p>\n<p><strong>Freedom of Expression</strong>: Respondents value anonymity as essential for:\n- Open discussion of sensitive topics\n- Protection from professional retaliation\n- Maintaining personal privacy from employers\n- Preserving the freedom to express unpopular opinions</p>\n<h6>Support for Real-Name Registration</h6>\n<p>Those favoring the requirement emphasize:</p>\n<p><strong>Accountability and Behavior</strong>: Supporters believe real-name registration would:\n- Reduce cyberbullying and online harassment\n- Discourage inflammatory speech and trolling\n- Make people more responsible for their online actions\n- Help combat scams and fraudulent behavior</p>\n<p><strong>Identity Verification</strong>: Some see benefits in:\n- Preventing impersonation and catfishing\n- Ensuring users are who they claim to be\n- Reducing bot accounts</p>\n<h6>Middle Ground Positions</h6>\n<p>Several respondents suggest compromise approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making real-name registration optional rather than mandatory</li>\n<li>Using verification systems (like checkmarks) for those who choose to verify</li>\n<li>Requiring real names for platform backend purposes while allowing pseudonyms publicly</li>\n<li>Distinguishing between platform requirements versus government mandates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diversity of perspectives reflects the complex balance between online safety, personal privacy, freedom of expression, and accountability in digital spaces. While some see real-name requirements as essential for creating safer online environments, others view them as dangerous invasions of privacy that could harm vulnerable individuals and stifle free expression.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                <div style=\"max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                    <p>Overall sentiment\n- Opposition dominated. About 57% opposed requiring real-name registration, roughly 33% supported it, and around 10% offered conditional or mixed views.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for opposing\n- Privacy and safety: Strong concerns about doxxing, stalking, harassment, domestic abuse situations, and exposure in hostile or restrictive environments.\n- Free expression and reputational risk: Fear of job loss, social or political backlash, and a chilling effect on speech.\n- Data security and trust: Worries about hacks, data breaches, government access, and platforms selling or misusing personal data.\n- Identity theft and fraud: Requiring more PII was seen as increasing risk rather than reducing it.\n- Limited effectiveness: Belief that determined bad actors can fake identities, use stolen IDs, or create multiple accounts; enforcement seen as impractical.\n- Participation costs: Some would reduce or stop using social media if forced to reveal their real identity.</p>\n<p>Main reasons for supporting\n- Accountability and civility: Expectation that tying accounts to real identities would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, hate, and misinformation.\n- Safety and integrity: Hoped-for reductions in scams, bots, catfishing, and impersonation; easier investigations; protection of minors; more credibility and authenticity.\n- Emerging risks: Concern that advances (e.g., AI misuse) heighten the need for verification.</p>\n<p>Conditional/compromise ideas\n- Platform-led, not government-mandated: Preference for platform verification over state requirements.\n- Backend verification with public pseudonyms: KYC-like checks held privately by platforms, with real names hidden unless there\u2019s abuse or legal need.\n- Optional verification: Voluntary \u201cverified\u201d badges for individuals, public figures, or businesses; encourage rather than coerce.\n- Strong safeguards: Data minimization, strict access controls, transparency, and due process for unmasking.</p>\n<p>Bottom line\n- Many value accountability benefits, but a larger share prioritize privacy, safety, and feasibility concerns. There is notable openness to privacy-preserving verification (optional or backend-only) rather than blanket, public real-name mandates.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_4": "4"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_4": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 33s "}}
