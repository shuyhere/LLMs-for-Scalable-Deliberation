Many participants emphasized that anonymity is essential for individuals in vulnerable situations, such as those experiencing domestic abuse or those with controversial political views. Others raised concerns about <strong>data security</strong>, noting the risks of identity theft and misuse of personal information by social media companies or governments.

Supporters believed that real-name policies could improve the overall quality of online discourse and help distinguish between genuine users and bots or malicious actors.</p>\n<p>Some respondents took a <strong>neutral or conditional stance</strong>, suggesting that real-name requirements could be acceptable if implemented carefully and with safeguards, such as allowing pseudonyms for personal use while ensuring real identities are on file for verification purposes. Others proposed <strong>alternative solutions</strong>, such as verified accounts with a symbol (e.g., a checkmark) to distinguish real identities without forcing all users to disclose them.</p>\n<p>In general, the discussion highlighted a <strong>tension between accountability and privacy</strong>, with many acknowledging the potential benefits of real-name policies while expressing reservations about their risks and ethical implications.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_4": "4"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 55s "}}
