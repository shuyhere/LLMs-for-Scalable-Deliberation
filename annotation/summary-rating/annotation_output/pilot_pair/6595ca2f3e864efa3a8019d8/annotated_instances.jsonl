While I think this policy is meant to combat the toxic nature of social media platforms by making users known and more accountable for their posts, and I am very much in support of that, I think there are also many good reasons for people to be anonymous online. I would worry that people posting under their own names would be vulnerable to identity theft, stalking, personal data harvesting, and many more negative outcomes that would outweigh any benefits."}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 5m 56s "}}

Some supporters believe it would foster a safer and more authentic online environment, especially for vulnerable groups like minors.</p>\n<p>Opponents raise concerns about privacy infringement, potential data misuse by companies or governments, and increased risks of identity theft, doxxing, or real-world harm. Many emphasize the importance of anonymity for protecting vulnerable individuals (e.g., domestic abuse survivors, marginalized groups, or those with dissenting opinions) and preserving freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>A smaller percentage express mixed or conditional views, suggesting that real-name registration might be acceptable if implemented by platforms (not governments), kept private in backend systems, or made optional with verification badges for those who choose it.
