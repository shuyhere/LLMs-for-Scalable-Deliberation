Respondents express distrust in social media companies' ability to protect personal data and fear misuse of collected information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Safety risks</strong>: A substantial portion highlight dangers including doxxing, stalking, identity theft, and real-world harassment. Particular concern exists for vulnerable populations such as domestic abuse survivors, minorities, and those with controversial political views who might face job loss or persecution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Freedom of expression</strong>: Respondents argue that anonymity enables open discourse and protects those who need to speak freely without fear of retribution. Many believe removing anonymity would suppress legitimate speech and create a chilling effect on online participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enforcement challenges</strong>: Several note the impracticality of verification without intrusive documentation requirements and point out that determined bad actors would find ways to circumvent any system.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Support Arguments</strong></p>\n<p>Those favoring real-name requirements emphasize potential benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accountability and behavior improvement</strong>: Supporters believe linking online actions to real identities would reduce cyberbullying, harassment, and the spread of misinformation. They argue people would act more responsibly when their reputation is at stake.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fraud prevention</strong>: Some see real-name registration as a solution to combat scams, catfishing, bot accounts, and identity theft, particularly important for protecting minors and vulnerable users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Authenticity</strong>: Proponents value the increased trust and credibility that comes with verified identities, especially for business interactions and public discourse.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Middle Ground Perspectives</strong></p>\n<p>A notable segment presents nuanced views:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some support backend verification for platform security while allowing public-facing pseudonyms</li>\n<li>Others suggest optional verification systems with visual indicators (like checkmarks) for those who choose to verify</li>\n<li>Several distinguish between platform-imposed requirements (more acceptable) versus government mandates (strongly opposed)</li>\n<li>Some acknowledge both benefits and risks, expressing ambivalence about the best approach</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Emerging Themes</strong></p>\n<p>The discussion reveals broader concerns about the evolving digital landscape, including the rise of AI-generated content, increasing online toxicity, and the balance between security and freedom. Many respondents who might have previously opposed such measures note that escalating online harassment and misinformation have made them reconsider, though most still ultimately prioritize privacy protection over potential safety benefits.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 14s "}}
