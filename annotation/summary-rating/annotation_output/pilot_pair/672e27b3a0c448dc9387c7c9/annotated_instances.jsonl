The debate centers on the conflict between promoting accountability and protecting user privacy and safety.</p>\n<p>A notable portion of commenters supports the proposal, primarily arguing that it would foster <strong>accountability and improve online behavior</strong>. Proponents believe that anonymity enables negative activities such as cyberbullying, harassment, the spread of misinformation, and scams. By linking online actions to real identities, they feel people would be more responsible and civil. This group also sees real-name registration as a tool to combat fake accounts, bots, and impersonation, thereby creating a safer and more authentic online environment, particularly for protecting vulnerable groups like minors.</p>\n<p>Conversely, a larger percentage of participants strongly oppose the requirement, citing fundamental concerns over <strong>privacy, safety, and freedom of expression</strong>. Opponents view the right to online anonymity as essential. They express deep distrust in the ability of social media companies to safeguard personal data, fearing it could be sold, misused, or exposed in data breaches. This could lead to severe real-world consequences, including identity theft, stalking, doxxing, and even physical harm. Many also argue that such a policy would have a chilling effect on free speech, as individuals might fear professional or social repercussions for expressing dissenting or unpopular opinions. For vulnerable individuals, such as victims of domestic abuse or political activists, anonymity is seen as a critical tool for safety.</p>\n<p>A number of participants hold a more nuanced view, acknowledging the merits of both sides. These commenters often propose <strong>compromise solutions</strong>. A frequently suggested alternative is a system of private verification where the platform confirms a user's real identity for internal accountability, but allows the user to post publicly under a pseudonym. This approach aims to hold malicious actors accountable without forcing all users to sacrifice their privacy and safety. Other suggestions include making identity verification an optional feature that grants users a \"verified\" badge, allowing others to choose who they interact with.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        ", "label_annotations": {"Which summary is more representative of your perspective?": {"scale_2": "2"}, "Which summary is more informative?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary presents a more neutral and balanced view of the issue?": {"scale_3": "3"}, "Which summary would you prefer of being used by the policy makers to make decisions relevant to the issue?": {"scale_2": "2"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}
