While some see real-name requirements as essential for creating safer online environments, others view them as dangerous invasions of privacy that could harm vulnerable individuals and stifle free expression.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div style=\"flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n                <h4 style=\"margin-top: 0; color: #2c5aa0;\">Summary B</h4>\n                <div style=\"max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; padding-right: 10px;\">\n                    <p>Overall summary of comments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sentiment split: Opposition outweighs support.
