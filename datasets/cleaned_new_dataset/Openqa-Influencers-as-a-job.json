Many news outlets are preset in what they will say based on a diverse mixup of staff leaning either left or right, making it much harder to find with you. Streamers and Video creators are much more plentiful and precise; By this logic, Its a viable profession path If you can get inital publicity, via signing up with a streaming group. Thats my thoughts"

Done with integrity, it widens who gets paid for creative labor, grows culture, and builds communities; the catch is that algorithms behave like fickle bosses, so creators need fair contracts, unions, and safety nets. Teach media literacy, require transparency about ads and AI, and I’m comfortable calling it a profession."

It anything it should be something more akin to a side hustle, and not the main pursuit for literally anyone. It is probably on the level of winning the lottery in luck needed to become an influencer. As for it being a profession, it should be recognized as a profession.

Now, it is possible to make it into a job that inspires tons of kids, which could be a good thing or not, but I believe the good outweighs the bad. However, there are bad apples within the internet influencers here and there, but it is a good thing to make new jobs."
