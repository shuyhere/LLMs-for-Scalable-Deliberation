Based on the professional service or polite attitude the may may turn out to be more then the tipping system. On the other hand you may want to tip big and you really just don’t have it financially to do so, in return you tip what you can to assure you let your server know you appreciated them."

I would improve it by having people who work those jobs be paid a living wage."

I think tipping should only be a thing on sit-down restaurants where you get full service and not a fast food place.

I think the minimum wage in the US should be raised across the board in order to one day end tipping culture."

Tipping system doesn't necessarily need changing, but all workers should make at the very least the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage has not changed since 2009 and needs to be livable, i.e. at least $15 / hour."
