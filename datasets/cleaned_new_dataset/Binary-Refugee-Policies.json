While I support refugees seeking a safe haven to escape war, I also feel strong immigration policies need to be implemented so that background checks or other procedures are implemented to help protect the country from allowing people into the country that have a criminal background or belong to a criminal group.

It's frustrating to me that a lot of people in my country not only feel that we should turn the refugees away but they even talk bad about them, and it's almost always people who base everything on their religion.
