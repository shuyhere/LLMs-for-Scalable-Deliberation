Now my smartphones are no longer viable within 5 years. I have even had situations where I do a 2 year payment plan, and then once the plan is over, my phone stops charging or working and I have to buy a new one. Additionally, companies change the charger type with new models leading people to have to buy more accessories."

The phone is just a bit faster a slightly better camera maybe an extra gig of ra,m but for the most part they're pretty similar to last year's phone.\n\nMy Pixel 6 from nearly 4 years ago still runs fine and works for everyday normal tasks, companies should do more to tell people that the previous year's devices are just as capable as this year's product"
