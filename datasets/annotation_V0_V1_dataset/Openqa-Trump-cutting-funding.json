Ditto for using these grants to compel the universities to abandon DEI initiatives.  That kind of thing should be backed by congressional action, not just the whim of the president.  So if Congress passed some laws saying you can't do DEI, then withholding grants to universities that didn't comply would be fine.

Schools will have to probably freeze the teachers pay which may mean teachers leaving the academic field altogether. Any repairs to the school itself will have to wait. These are only some of the issues I see for now  I am sure more issues will arise. Enrollment may also go down if the school is not able to provide an adequate education because of the cut."

      "comment": "Universities betrayed their core duties to prepare students for a successful life, to give them a stable and balanced understanding of the world, and to foster innovation instead of indoctrination. 90% of the hate and bigotry in society is now driven directly by social revolutionaries in the academic world who actively teach students to reject fair-mindedness and personal responsibility; to judge everyone only by who they are instead of what they do; to replace morality with self-worship while glorifying crime and ter*orism; and infecting the objective sciences with a deluded form of sociology that makes modern university graduates destructive to any company or government that hires them. Universities and their students are by far the most undeservedly hyper-privileged people on Earth, sitting on billions in endowments they did little to earn while demanding funding from the same working people they teach their students to hate; and it is the universities, not Trump, who constantly silence and threaten their political enemies, while Trump justly prevents the theft of our taxes by privileged academic aristocrats who think they can steal money from the working class with no one's consent while giving the country nothing but poison and propaganda in return."
