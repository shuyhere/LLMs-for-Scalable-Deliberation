Many news outlets are preset in what they will say based on a diverse mixup of staff leaning either left or right, making it much harder to find with you. Streamers and Video creators are much more plentiful and precise; By this logic, Its a viable profession path If you can get inital publicity, via signing up with a streaming group. Thats my thoughts"

Done with integrity, it widens who gets paid for creative labor, grows culture, and builds communities; the catch is that algorithms behave like fickle bosses, so creators need fair contracts, unions, and safety nets. Teach media literacy, require transparency about ads and AI, and I’m comfortable calling it a profession."

It anything it should be something more akin to a side hustle, and not the main pursuit for literally anyone. It is probably on the level of winning the lottery in luck needed to become an influencer. As for it being a profession, it should be recognized as a profession.

I think it's strange that they've gotten the amount of positive notoriety they have that now has them amongst famous musicians/actors and people of that sort, though. It's a real profession, and I think deserves to be recognized as one, but it's still weird to me to see them invited to the Met Gala and stuff like that."
