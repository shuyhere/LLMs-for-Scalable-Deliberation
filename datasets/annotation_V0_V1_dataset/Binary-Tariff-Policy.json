While raising prices overall, they will not succeed in their goal of reshoring industry back to the US since the factories and supply chains have vanished and are difficult to rebuilt. Many companies are confused by the capricious tariffs and prefer to wait it out rather than invest in reshoring their operations back to America. Also, these tariffs tarnish the US's image as a fair and responsible trading partner."
