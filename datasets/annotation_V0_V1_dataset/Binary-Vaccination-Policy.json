      "index": 13,

      "index": 17,
      "comment": "No, I do NOT support the government having the power to FORCE people to get vaccinated. The reason for this is that vaccination is a health issue, and there's no guarantee that the vaccine will even be safe, like what happened during the coronavirus pandemic where we had to get vaccinated or we'd lose certain freedoms, and the vaccine wasn't even safe because of all the side effects that people who took it suffered from or even died from."

      "comment": "I think that the government can and should enforce quarantine measures in response to a severe epidemic.  However, I don't think that they should force vaccinations upon people.  The vaccine was likely developed in response to the epidemic and doesn't have the longitudinal data to support making individuals receive it."

    {
      "index": 19,
      "comment": "I think the government should have the authority to enforce vaccine and quarantine measures. Those who don't follow these mandatory guidelines will be criminally penalized, prohibited from work, or marked unvaccinated as a warning and to prepare others from catching the virus. It sounds harsh, but if this severe epidemic caused the death of thousands or millions of people in a short time, like COVID, the government must look out for its people."

      "index": 35,
      "comment": "I support the government having the authority to enforce vaccination and quarantine measures because the faster people get immunized and protected, the faster the epidemic will end.

      "index": 47,
      "comment": "As long as the government is funding these vaccinations and these vaccinations are actually doing what they are supposed to be, I see no reason why it shouldn't be enforceable. I suppose this so long as the funding does not require the person getting it to pay for it, otherwise this becomes a wealth disparity situation as well where you're punished for not being able to afford the vaccination."

There is nothing wrong with enforcing through media and commercials, ad's ... but people should have free will regarding this. *And maybe they should stop cooking up sicknesses in the lab so people wont need to go through these things* ;)"

If they do not get it, I think they should be willing to stay home or accept the consequences, and if someone falls ill due to their poor decisions, they should be fined. Ultimately, I think it should be a case-by-case basis, but the majority of people I think should be made to receive the vaccine."

      "comment": "Vaccinations-No, We should be able to decide what we put in our bodies as personal, individual decisions without government interference.

As a precaution, the public should be aware of everything."

While I sympathize with those who want to maintain bodily autonomy, as I've grown older (and even during the beginning of the pandemic 5 years ago) I recognize that there are certain things that we must do as citizens to maintain a certain social good. and Part of that includes vaccinations and/or quarantine measures to ensure those more vulnerable among us don't get sick and in order to help curtail the contagion. Stop the spread!"

      "comment": "Yes, I support it because we cannot trust all of the public to make sensible decisions that keeps the majority of us safe. There are many citizens who need protection, especially children, the elderly, and the immune compromised. It is unfortunate that it takes government policy to enforce these things to do our best to reduce the harm and death toll caused by an epidemic."

If there were another virus like the one that causes smallpox or polio, something so devastating like that should not be left in the hands of dumb people who make up vaccine danger conspiracy theories.
