Based on the professional service or polite attitude the may may turn out to be more then the tipping system. On the other hand you may want to tip big and you really just don’t have it financially to do so, in return you tip what you can to assure you let your server know you appreciated them."

I would improve it by having people who work those jobs be paid a living wage."

I think tipping should only be a thing on sit-down restaurants where you get full service and not a fast food place.

Tipping system doesn't necessarily need changing, but all workers should make at the very least the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage has not changed since 2009 and needs to be livable, i.e. at least $15 / hour."

I mean I’m not going to eat to give away $30-$40 to a waiter or waitress five dollars tops for me and given that this waitress of waiter or get five dollars minimum from an eight hour shift they almost made their whole salary or at least a quarter of it and just tips so I don’t feel bad if I don’t give them but a dollar or two.

If I go to a convenience store to purchase a product and they have a tip jar I will not tip. I would change the system by making tipping mandatory if the service you received was good. You could create a set of standards and if they are fulfilled at an 80% level then tipping should be mandatory for service industries."

The current tipping system should be discontinued in favor of employer paying employees a living wage, or at least minimum wage.  Tipping should be solely at the discretion of the consumer, not an expectation. The current system of requesting a tip on nearly every bill presented to consumers, regardless of the service provided or even when personal services is not provided, now feels like everyone and every store is begging for more money from me."
