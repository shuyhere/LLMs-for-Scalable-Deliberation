It is obvious that the open market is not able to provide for the social good, economic good or even provide good healthcare left to its own devices. Right now, it is entirely to problematic that people cannot get healthcare, there is little access to healthcrea nd healthcare is wildly expensive. We have nothing to show for it either, we have little good outcomes."
