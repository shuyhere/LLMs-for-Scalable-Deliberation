SIRI Is a powerful search tool on the Apple iPhone, and I have found that she aids me in finding answers to questions that would take time to open up a webpage and type in the question, now all I have to do is call her name and ask the question and I have it in instantaneously. There are other AI programs out there in the world and chat. GPT is the only other one I have used. If I’m on my computer, I have found a ChatGPT is he interesting system but it is not as convenient as using SIRI. Siri has changed my life in in the fact that she makes it easier to find answers instantaneously."
