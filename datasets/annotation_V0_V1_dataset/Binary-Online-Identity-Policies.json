      "comment": "I see the merits of such a system, and I think for just social media it's probably ok. This way, users real identities become attached to what they do online.

By having users apply this measure, this will ensure that they are safely recognized as the actual user of this social media account and it has not been created by some imposter or person with fake intentions.
