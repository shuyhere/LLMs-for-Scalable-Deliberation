12240,Negative,Initially it will impact economy but should be best overall for economy and society.,"Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12239,Negative,"The tariff policy will only increase the cost of consumer goods which has a disproportionate affect on the middle class, those living in poverty, and underserved/minority communities. By going back and forth on the tariff policies, Trump and his cronies have manipulated the stock market for personal, ill gotten gains at the expense of the American people and our economy.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12238,Negative,Tariffs make everything we buy more expensive. The costs will be passed on to us as the consumers. It's already causing our farmers to not be able to sell their crops because they are buying from other countries with lower tariffs. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

Some stores might have to close if they won't have the suppport of customers because of the increased prices.",I’m not sure
12233,Negative,The USA is rich because of its trade with its neighbors and foreign countries. The attempt to use tariffs to increase manufacturing in the US is incredibly stupid as US does NOT have capacity to replace all of its trade with internal only production. It is the most stupid and dumb thing I've ever seen,"Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12232,I am not sure,"Its truly 50/50 .  I have personally not seen many prices come down .

12223,Negative,The US industry base cannot be rebuilt overnight. Consumers will be footing the bills,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12220,Negative,The price of things are already too high from inflation. Increased costs from tariffs will just make people buy less which could have a negative impact on the economy. ,I’m not sure

12216,Positive,"AI has revolutionized the way I approach problem-solving by providing efficient and accurate tools for data analysis, research, and coding. It has streamlined my work processes and enhanced my ability to explore new concepts and solutions. The accessibility of AI tools has allowed me to achieve more in less time, improving both productivity and creativity.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12215,Negative,"The farmers that voted him in are now crying and wanting subsidies, they want government help. America is producing less products for consumption, instead the farmers are burning crop they can't sell because of the tariffs. The tariffs are passed on to the consumer, which increases the cost over all products substantially.",I’m not sure
12214,Negative,"I think the current tariff policy under the Trump administration will have a negative impact on the overall U.S. economy and society.

In the long run, they can hurt competitiveness and weaken economic growth.","Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12211,Negative,"It is going to have an overall negative impact on the US because we rely so much on imports from different countries, like China. Most importantly, we get the most important materials like medical equipment and supplies from other countries so the costs of the tariffs are going to strain healthcare. On top of that, everything is just gonna be more expensive to pay and Americans are already struggling with making enough income.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12208,Negative,The increase in tariffs will trickle down to the consumers. It will make everything more expensive and people will have to cut back on their spending.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

12205,Negative,"The current tariff policy is just going to make products that Americans buy more expensive. We were already dealing with high inflation so this will make matters worse.

Some companies will go out of business or will need to lay off employees, further damaging the economy.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12203,Negative,Tariffs will lead to increase in prices that average people like me will have to cover. And money is very tight these days. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12202,Negative,Tariffs always gets to the people who could least afford it. That will drag the economy down,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

12187,Negative,"I think costs from tariffs will be passed along to consumers, which will have an inflationary effect. The fed will be less willing to lower interest rates, leading to a sluggish economy, compared to where we would be without tariffs.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12186,Negative,"The current tariff policy under the Trump administration may protect certain domestic industries in the short term but risks raising costs for consumers and businesses reliant on global supply chains.

12178,Negative,It’s only beneficial to people in power. The citizens and businesses are the ones that actually pay the tariffs. It’s causing the dollar to go down and losing business with countries,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12177,Negative,We live in a global economy now. Pretending that we can go isolationist and still succeed as a world economic superpower is naive at best. The rest of the world will wait out this administration instead of making meaningful production changes and american consumers will suffer in the meantime.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12176,Negative,It has made everything so much more expensive. It's raising the cost of living for everything and making it unaffordable. We do not have the infrastructure/foundation to immediately switch to using just US produced products.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12175,Negative,The price always transfers and trickles down to the customer. Therefore increasing the prices we pay for consumer goods.,I’m not sure

12165,Negative,I think it would definitely cause a negative impact. This is because items that would normally cost around 3-4 dollars will now probably have a cost of 10-12 dollars.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12164,Negative,"Trump doesn't understand, or care, how tariffs work. Not only is his policy idiotic, the schizophrenic implementation makes fiscal planning impossible. The guy is seriously dangerous and needs to be removed and institutionalized. Will no one intervene in time to save our country before this grotesque and bothersome menace leads us over the brink? ","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12157,Negative,The tariffs are pulling money out of the pocket of regular every day consumers. In the last couple weeks we have seen the effects through European countries mostly which have switched to manufacturers/companies in other for their goods instead of the U.S.,I’m not sure
12151,Positive,I think that this policy will support US businesses and encourage people to buy US products. I also think that the tariffs will bring in a lot of money from imports.,I’m not sure
12146,Negative,I think the ones who will end up paying the increase of tariff policies are the normal consumers. The tariff will affect the normal American people who are going to be paying more money for goods.,"Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12145,Negative,"Companies will not just pay the costs of tariffs. The costs will be passed down to the consumer and products will be more expensive, so it works like a regressive tax on poor people who can already barely afford to live.",I’m not sure
12142,Negative,The tariffs position has been inconsistent and businesses need consistency to invest. Tarriffs make things more inexensive for regular customers which reduces demand and it damages relationships with allies and key trading partners,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12139,Negative,I'm not 100% confident but I think tariffs will just make things more expensive for every day purchases. If it costs more money to import things from around the world then prices will only get higher to make up for that. That would mean less purchasing and lead to a more stagnated economy.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

12123,Negative,All prices will rise. Manufacturing can’t be immediately offshored. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12114,Negative,I think that it will just drive the prices up for most consumers. Prices are already fairly high and I think this will just make things more harder financially for both consumers and small businesses. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12113,Negative,"I think the tariffs are a terrible idea. They've already proven to be, as costs of several things have gone up because of rising import costs.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12111,I am not sure,"I'm not sure, I haven't done extensive research on it. If any positive effects occur, it seems they would be over the long term if anything. I'm aware prices are up on certain things and I hear mostly complaints about it. One thing I've noticed is businesses like Temu which flood the market with useless cheap junk have been greatly affected, which I consider a good thing. Either way, I'm not supportive or staunchly against it as of now.",I’m not sure
12107,Positive,This will protect the company in our country and help to bring jobs back to the US. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

12100,I am not sure,I am non-political. I don't  understand much of whatever topics that are governmental or political in origin,"Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12096,Negative,"I don’t know, I just think anything the government touches or imposes or regulates goes to hell",I’m not sure
12094,Negative,It seems like the costs will mostly be passed down to consumers and we have no way to combat that. wal-mart has already said they'll increase their prices instead of eating the tarriffs and i am sure most companies will do the same.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12093,Negative,"I think the current tariff policy will have a negative impact because it makes imported goods more expensive for people and businesses. This can lead to higher prices in stores and fewer choices. It also might hurt trade with other countries, which can slow down the economy.",I’m not sure
12092,Positive,People will produce more products in the USA and get funding from foreign countries and use it for the safety net in the USA. Trump Administration will not want the foreign policy or trade budgets inflated in the USA they want to keep money here in the country they are worried about the deficit.,"Yes, my opinion differs from the majority view"
12091,Negative,"It will have a negative impact because it makes living in the usa unaffordable to live. People cant buy a home, car or food.",I’m not sure
12088,I am not sure,"I honestly go both ways on this.  I can see why this was done, however, as someone who works multiple jobs to be very poor, it has affected me negatively.  I just have to hope I see the change it is supposed to make",I’m not sure
12086,Negative,Donald Trump only knows how to bankrupt himself and the country,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12078,Positive,"I think that even though it is rough right now because the prices of things have gone up, it will benefit our country in the long run. It'll bring jobs back to America and make America way less dependent on other countries for our essentials. We need to be able to fully support our own nation, independent of others. ","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12073,Negative,Im afraid of buying of my hobbies from outside the US because I’ll be hit with a tariff charge. Also when I did order some products they increased the price to cover tariffs. ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12072,Negative,"Increasing the cost of all goods, including those of unprocessed materials can only have a negative impact of the economy as a whole. The US economy depends on free trade and attempting to upend the entire system on a whim is stupid beyond belief. ","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12064,Positive,The current tariff policy is lead to less tariffs and a fairer balance of trade which will bring in revenue and balance the budget. A balanced budget leads to greater economy and national security which will brining businesses back to the US.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
12062,Negative,"I already see the negatives. People are struggling since Trump’s policies. I see evidence of shrinkflation at restaurants, higher prices for lots of goods online and in stores. The people are struggling while the rich get richer.",I’m not sure
12060,Negative,I think the tariffs will make the cost of items increase in price. I think the average American is already feeling the cost increases on groceries and household items that have increased since Covid started.

12036,Negative,"We're already seeing the negative affects for many people--goods that we buy cheap (Temu, etc.) are no longer accessible.

11489,Negative,"With the tariff hike under this administration, I believe prices overall will increase to offset companies' having to pay those exorbitant fees. The impact on the economy then will be negative because consumers won't be willing to pay such absurd prices for goods that have historically been much less.",I’m not sure
11488,Negative,Tariff tax cost that consumers cost is costing everyday living more expense.  If tariff tax was important why other president established in other years.  ,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11487,Positive,"Wisely implemented tariffs can even level the unfair trade, revive manufacturing, and enhance the resilience of U.S. supply-chain and national security. They might push the prices higher in the short-run, but I would say that the benefits of the jobs and bargaining power are greater than the costs in the long-run.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"

11482,Negative,Tariff's are just another way to pass higher prices on to the consumer.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11480,Negative,"The tariff policy will likely have a negative impact because it raises prices for consumers, hurts exports, and slows economic growth more than it helps certain industries.",I’m not sure
11479,Positive,It seems like the tariffs received by US balance out the high tariffs US was paying. Some countries were also producing many goods imported to the US while also receiving high tariffs. So it seems fair for the US to also produce goods and have similar tariffs to what they pay.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11478,Negative,Goods are going to cost more to be imported and the importer is passing down the extra cost to the buyers,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11476,Negative,"Although the tariffs are in place so that U.S. based businesses could thrive as people had more reason to buy American products, but prices for many everyday items would go up. Most of us consumers are barely living paycheck to paycheck, we can’t afford more expensive goods. ",I’m not sure
11475,Negative,"I think the amount of tariff this current administration is trying to impose will result in higher prices for all consumer goods and services. If other countries need to pay higher tariffs to export their goods to the US, then they will have to raise their prices, and these higher prices will then be passed on to US consumers.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11473,Negative,"Tariffs only work if there's a suitable industry to protect in international trade. The sectors the administration are trying to 'protect' are either in their infancy, or do not really exist yet.

11467,Negative,The Trump Administration's tariffs have done nothing but cause harm to the global economy. They serve no purpose and have done nothing but worsen international trade relations.,I’m not sure
11465,Negative,I think prices will end up going up as the tariff costs are passed on to the consumer and everyday shoppers will feel the hit and maybe decide to go out less or shop less. I also think we will see a lot of smaller and mom and pop stores close as people will shift towards the big box companies that can absorb these higher costs. So I think both buyers and sellers will hurt from these changes as their effects become more noticeable.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11462,Negative,"Companies will eventually move costs to consumers. The argument that companies will absorb the costs is weak, as non-tariff competitors will most likely increase regardless of their advantages. ",I’m not sure

11426,Negative,I think Tariffs ultimately increase the price of goods for the US consumer. In today's globalized trading world often different countries handle different components of manufacturing and assembly of complex electronics and other goods. So imposing tariffs on foreign goods adds difficulties and complexity for the US manufacturers and consumers.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
11424,Negative,I feel like a lot of people don't actually understand how tariffs work. The company we are buying from gets taxes which they then increase their prices so WE can recoup them for that.

11396,Negative,"I believe the current tariff policy will lead to increases in prices across multiple categories of products for consumers.

11383,Positive,"I believe the Trump era tariffs helped protect American industries from unfair foreign competition, especially from China.

10873,Negative,"I understand that Trump is trying to bring business back to the US and restrict the amount of imports that we have to use in order to conduct business, but we are far from prepared for that. I think starting with implementing the tariffs is backwards. Work on preparing the businesses, manufacturers, and factories for creating materials in the US before starting a tariff war with the countries that we need for supplies now.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
10872,Negative,"Well, the reason why I selected negative is because I'm already starting to see the impact of the tariffs already.  Things that I like to buy have increased in price recently and it is because of the tariffs.  For example, video game consoles have increased in price by 50 or more dollars which is kind of outrageous because it goes against the norm.  ","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
10871,Positive,I think it will have a positive effect because it will get us more money and power over the countries instead of us paying them all the time and them having the upper hand.

10859,Positive,In my opinion  the current tariff policy under the Trump administration will have a positive impact on the overall of US economy and society. Tariffs would force many US companies to bring back their production or at least part of their production process back to US. The result would be in the employment of more US workers and collected taxes.,I’m not sure

10855,I am not sure,"If we are judging the immediate future, then I would have to say the tariffs will have a negative impact.

10849,Negative,It will increase the prices for the everyday consumer. It will also hinder our relationships with other country's and their supplies.,I’m not sure
10848,Negative,"Tariffs will inevitably cause prices on goods to rise. Even US made products often rely on foreign materials.

10843,Negative,It makes people less likely to buy anything online. I'm one of those people. I think they will be less likely to buy things from overseas and then those overseas people/companies will tank in money and lose a lot of profit so it isn't good in the longrun esp for businesses who get their items overseas.,I’m not sure
10842,I am not sure,I have mixed feelings about this topic. On one side I trust Trump's administration but some policies are starting to get ridiculous.,I’m not sure

10840,Negative,Because prices for goods such as foods are steadily increasing.,"No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
10838,Negative,"The cost has to come from where, either the business owners will close or they will increase prices which will hurt the businesses by people not buying or people will buy less because items will all cost more.

10837,Negative,"Everything is definitely more expensive. I went to the auto parts store yesterday. For the items I purchased, had I purchased them two years ago, they would have cost me about $70. Instead, those items cost around $105.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
10835,Negative,Tariffs rarely work but when they are started by an idiot the chance of a positive outcome is VERY slim.

10819,Negative,"The tariffs are causing the prices of everything to go up, in addition to extremely high tariff payments on online orders brought in from other countries. The combination of this has caused consumers to stop buying as much, causing less money to go into the economy.","No, my opinion aligns with the majority view"
10818,I am not sure,We have not tried tariffs are this scale in my lifetime so I do not know what impacts it will have on the economy. ,I’m not sure

There are many opinions floating around the internet, and some say things are going to go horribly wrong while others think things will be great.

I feel like if we were to place tariffs, we should at least make sure we have factories and other things in place to pick things up.
