    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation on the U.S. tariff policy**\n\n- **Overall sentiment:** The overwhelming majority of participants view the policy as detrimental. Roughly **four‑fifths** of the comments stress that tariffs are raising prices for consumers, squeezing small businesses, and harming the broader economic climate.\n\n- **Key concerns raised**\n  * **Higher consumer costs:** Most respondents point to noticeable price hikes on everyday goods, which they say reduce household purchasing power and dampen overall consumer spending.\n  * **Impact on small firms and logistics:** A sizable share highlights that small‑business owners and companies in the shipping/transport sector are facing tighter margins, order cancellations, and reduced demand.\n  * **Trade‑relationship strain:** Many note that tariffs are damaging diplomatic and commercial ties—especially with China and other major partners—leading to retaliation and a loss of the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.\n  * **Uncertainty for investment:** Several comments mention that the unpredictable, “capricious” nature of the tariffs discourages domestic and foreign investment and creates broader economic uncertainty.\n  * **Limited short‑term benefits:** While a few participants acknowledge that tariffs generate additional government revenue, most argue that the gains are modest and do not offset the broader costs to consumers and businesses.\n\n- **Perceived positive or mixed effects**\n  * About **15 %** of the remarks suggest that tariffs could eventually protect certain domestic industries, help renegotiate trade deals, or provide long‑run fiscal benefits. These views often frame the policy as a short‑term “investment” that may pay off after an adjustment period.\n  * A small minority (roughly **5 %**) express outright optimism, citing potential job creation, increased “fairness” in trade, or the idea that the policy could eventually boost domestic manufacturing if fully realized.\n\n- **Long‑term outlook**\n  * Many participants who see any upside stress that any positive impact is likely to materialize only after a prolonged transition, and that the immediate pain—higher prices, reduced consumer confidence, and strained international relations—dominates the present experience.\n  * Conversely, the few who are hopeful about long‑run gains stress the need for a more targeted, strategic approach rather than the broad, blanket tariffs currently in place.\n\n**Conclusion:** The consensus is that the current tariff regime is largely harming the U.S. economy and society in the short term, primarily through higher consumer prices and pressures on small businesses, while any prospective long‑term benefits are viewed as uncertain and contingent on significant policy adjustments.",
