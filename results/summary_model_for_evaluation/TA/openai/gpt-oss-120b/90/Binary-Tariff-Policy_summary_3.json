    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant perception:** The overwhelming majority of respondents view the current tariff policy as detrimental to the U.S. economy and society. Roughly eight‑in‑ten participants emphasize that tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which in turn pushes up consumer prices, squeezes household budgets, and depresses overall consumer spending.  \n\n- **Key concerns:**  \n  * **Higher prices & inflation:** Most comments point to rising costs for everyday items, groceries, fuel and other essentials, arguing that these price hikes erode purchasing power, especially for low‑ and middle‑income households.  \n  * **Impact on small businesses:** A sizeable share notes that small firms—particularly those reliant on imported components or finished products—are feeling the strain, with some reporting reduced orders, tighter margins, or even closures.  \n  * **Trade relations & retaliation:** Many respondents worry that tariffs damage diplomatic and commercial ties, provoke retaliatory measures from trading partners, and undermine the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.  \n  * **Uncertainty for investment:** Several participants highlight that the unpredictable nature of the tariff regime discourages domestic and foreign investment, slowing growth and innovation.  \n  * **Limited short‑term job gains:** While a small number mention potential job creation in certain protected industries, most argue that any such gains are modest, delayed, and outweighed by broader economic costs.\n\n- **Mixed or nuanced views:** About one‑in‑six participants acknowledge that tariffs could have some positive effects, such as:  \n  * Generating additional federal revenue that might help reduce the deficit.  \n  * Providing temporary protection for specific domestic sectors, potentially preserving certain jobs.  \n  * Offering leverage in future trade negotiations.  \n\n  However, even among these more optimistic voices, the benefits are often framed as long‑term or conditional, and many still caution that the short‑run pain—especially higher consumer prices—remains significant.\n\n- **Positive‑only outlooks:** A small minority (roughly five percent) express unequivocally positive sentiments, citing expectations that tariffs will ultimately rebalance trade, make U.S. products more competitive, and boost the overall economy once the policy stabilizes.\n\n- **Overall tone:** The collective sentiment is one of skepticism and concern. The prevailing narrative is that tariffs, as currently implemented, impose immediate costs on consumers and businesses, generate trade tensions, and create economic uncertainty, with only limited and uncertain prospects for future gains.",
