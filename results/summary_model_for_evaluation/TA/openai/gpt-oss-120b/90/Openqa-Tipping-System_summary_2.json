    "main_points": "The collection of remarks reveals a strong consensus that the present tipping framework is overly intrusive and tied to low wages rather than genuine service quality. Roughly three‑quarters of the contributors argue that tips should be optional and tied to the merit of the service, with many insisting that workers receive a livable, minimum‑wage salary so that customers are not forced to subsidize payroll. A similar share (about 65 %) calls for the removal of mandatory or pre‑selected tip options on point‑of‑sale screens, suggesting that “no‑tip” choices be clearly visible or that tip prompts be eliminated entirely for transactions that do not involve personal service (e.g., pick‑up orders, coffee counters, fast‑food kiosks).\n\nAmong those who still value tipping, the prevailing view (around 55 %) is that it should reward exceptional service only, with the amount reflecting the quality of the interaction rather than a fixed percentage of the bill. Some respondents (approximately 40 %) propose replacing discretionary tips with a modest, transparent service charge (often cited as 10 % or a fixed dollar amount such as $20–$30) that would be included in the price and distributed to staff. A smaller but notable segment (about 25 %) looks to European‑style models, where employers pay a full wage and tips are either rare or purely voluntary gestures of gratitude.\n\nAcross the board, there is widespread criticism of the way modern POS systems push suggested tip percentages before service is rendered, which many describe as “pressuring” or “scamming” customers. Respondents also highlight inconsistencies—tips are expected for low‑effort interactions (e.g., at self‑serve stations or for simple cashiers) while being optional for full‑service dining—fueling the perception that the system is unfair and confusing.\n\nIn summary, the dominant sentiment is that tipping should be an optional, merit‑based thank‑you rather than a compulsory supplement to wages. Most participants advocate for employers to assume responsibility for a fair, livable wage, for tip prompts to be removed or made truly optional, and for any mandatory service charge to be modest, transparent, and uniformly applied to services that truly merit it.",
