    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Mandatory tipping is widely viewed as a problem.** A large majority of the comments (well over half) call for tipping to be optional rather than required, and many argue that the practice of prompting customers with preset tip percentages or “mandatory” tip screens is intrusive and pressuring.\n\n- **Link to low wages.** Across the responses, a strong consensus (roughly two‑thirds) ties the tipping culture to inadequate base pay. Commenters repeatedly suggest that employers should provide a livable, minimum‑wage salary so that workers are not forced to rely on tips for basic income. Several proposals mention raising the federal or state minimum wage to around $15 per hour.\n\n- **Preferred alternatives to the current model.**  \n  - **Service‑charge model:** About a third of the remarks favor replacing voluntary tips with a fixed service charge (e.g., 10 % or a flat $20–$30 amount), similar to practices in some European or Asian systems.  \n  - **Fixed‑amount tips:** A notable minority (around 20 %) propose moving away from percentage‑based suggestions toward fixed dollar amounts, or allowing customers to choose a set tip after service.  \n  - **Reward‑based ideas:** A small but distinct set of comments suggest adding tangible acknowledgments—thank‑you notes, coupons, or small gifts—to make tipping feel more reciprocal.\n\n- **When tipping should be appropriate.** Most participants (approximately 60 %) agree that tips should be tied to genuine service quality. They draw a line between full‑service restaurant dining (where tipping feels justified) and low‑interaction transactions such as coffee pick‑up, fast‑food counters, or self‑service kiosks, which many feel should not trigger a tip prompt.\n\n- **Perception of tipping as “good‑deed” vs. “obligation.”** While a segment (around 30 %) still sees tipping as a positive way to reward hard work and encourage excellent service, many of those same voices stress that it should remain a voluntary expression of gratitude rather than a societal expectation.\n\n- **Technology and presentation concerns.** Numerous comments highlight the frustration with point‑of‑sale tablets that default to suggested tip amounts, often making “no tip” difficult to select. The call for clearer, easy‑to‑find “no tip” options or the removal of tip prompts for non‑service transactions appears in a sizable portion of the feedback.\n\n- **Cultural comparisons.** Several respondents reference European or Japanese practices where tipping is either minimal or embedded in the price, using these examples to argue for a shift away from the U.S. model.\n\n- **Overall sentiment.** The prevailing mood is that the current tipping system is “out of control,” “pressuring,” and “unfairly shifts wage responsibility onto customers.” Most commenters would like to see a restructuring that either eliminates mandatory tips, introduces a transparent service charge, or, most fundamentally, ensures workers receive a stable, livable wage independent of customer generosity. At the same time, a respectable minority still values tipping as a tool for rewarding exceptional service, provided it remains truly optional and clearly tied to the quality of the experience.",
