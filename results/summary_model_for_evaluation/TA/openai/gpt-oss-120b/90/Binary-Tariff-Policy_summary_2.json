    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation on the U.S. tariff policy**\n\n- **Overall perception:** The vast majority of respondents view the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society. Roughly 80 % describe it as having a negative impact, while only about 5 % see it as clearly positive. The remaining 15 % express mixed or conditional views, suggesting possible long‑term benefits if the policy is refined.\n\n- **Key concerns driving the negative view**\n  - **Higher consumer prices:** Most comments stress that tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which in turn pushes up everyday prices for food, fuel, and household items. This price pressure is seen as eroding purchasing power, especially for low‑ and middle‑income households.\n  - **Burden on small businesses:** Many participants note that small firms, which rely on imported inputs, face tighter margins or are forced to raise their own prices, threatening their viability.\n  - **Trade‑relationship damage:** A sizable share point to deteriorating diplomatic and commercial ties—particularly with China and other major partners—leading to retaliation, reduced market access, and a loss of U.S. “soft power.”\n  - **Uncertainty and investment climate:** The unpredictability of the tariffs is described as discouraging domestic and foreign investment, with firms opting to delay or cancel reshoring plans.\n  - **Societal effects:** Several comments link higher prices to broader social strain, including reduced consumer spending, potential recession risks, and heightened hardship for vulnerable populations.\n\n- **Arguments for potential benefits**\n  - **Domestic industry protection:** Some respondents argue that tariffs could shield certain U.S. sectors, preserve jobs, and “force” a shift toward domestic production over the long run.\n  - **Fiscal revenue:** A few participants cite the increase in tariff collections as a boost to federal revenue that could help address deficits.\n  - **Strategic leverage:** A minority view the policy as a bargaining tool to renegotiate trade agreements or correct perceived imbalances.\n\n- **Conditional or mixed perspectives**\n  - **Short‑term pain vs. long‑term gain:** Several comments acknowledge immediate price spikes and economic disruption but suggest that benefits might accrue later if the policy is targeted and stable.\n  - **Sector‑specific outcomes:** A few remarks note that while some industries may gain, the overall net effect is still negative for the broader economy and most consumers.\n\n- **Consensus on next steps**\n  - Respondents who see any upside stress the need for a more selective, transparent, and predictable tariff regime.\n  - The dominant recommendation is to reduce or eliminate blanket tariffs, mitigate price impacts on consumers, and pursue trade policies that maintain healthy international relationships while supporting genuine domestic competitiveness.",
