    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad dissatisfaction with mandatory tipping** – Roughly three‑quarters of the respondents feel that the current system forces customers to tip even when no meaningful service has been provided.  Common grievances include the pressure created by point‑of‑sale screens that default to a tip, the expansion of tipping requests to low‑value transactions (e.g., coffee, pickup orders, fast‑food counters), and the perception that tipping is being used by employers to avoid paying a livable wage.\n\n- **Calls for a living wage** – A similarly large share (about 70 %) argue that workers, especially restaurant staff and delivery drivers, should receive a base salary that meets basic cost‑of‑living standards.  When workers are paid a fair wage, many say tipping would become optional rather than obligatory.\n\n- **Preference for optional or service‑based tipping** – Around half of the comments suggest that tips should be tied to the quality of service and offered only when a customer feels it is deserved.  Suggestions include:\n  * Making the tip button “0 %” clearly visible and easy to select.\n  * Removing pre‑set percentage suggestions or reducing them to modest levels.\n  * Using fixed‑amount tips (e.g., a $20‑$30 standard) instead of percentage‑based calculations for larger bills.\n  * Providing non‑monetary acknowledgments such as thank‑you notes or coupons when a tip is given.\n\n- **Alternative structures** – About one‑third of participants propose replacing the tip‑percentage model with a transparent service charge (e.g., a flat 10 % or a modest surcharge) that is automatically added to the bill, similar to practices in many European countries and Japan.  Others advocate for a hybrid approach: a mandatory modest service fee combined with an optional extra for exceptional service.\n\n- **Support for tipping in specific contexts** – Roughly 20 % of the comments express that tipping remains appropriate for full‑service, sit‑down restaurant experiences or for delivery services where workers rely heavily on tips.  These commenters tend to emphasize generous tipping as an incentive for high‑quality service and often mention personal habits of tipping 20 % or more.\n\n- **Critiques of the “tip‑to‑cover‑low‑wage” model** – Many‑of‑the‑comments label the system a “scam” or “underpayment strategy,” arguing that it shifts the responsibility for fair compensation from employers to customers.  This view is frequently linked to calls for policy changes such as raising the federal minimum wage to at least $15 / hour.\n\n- **Technological friction** – A noticeable portion (about 15 %) highlight how modern tablet or app‑based ordering interfaces make it hard to refuse a tip, especially when the “no tip” option is buried or requires extra taps.  The recommendation is to redesign these interfaces so that opting out is as simple as opting in.\n\n- **Cultural observations** – Several commenters note that the U.S. tipping culture is unusually pervasive compared with other nations, and they suggest looking to European or Asian models where tips are either modest, optional, or baked into menu prices.\n\n**Key Take‑aways**\n\n1. **The dominant sentiment is a desire to make tipping truly optional and linked to service quality**, rather than a default expectation for every transaction.  \n2. **A majority view the root problem as inadequate base wages**, and they propose that employers should shoulder the primary responsibility for fair compensation.  \n3. **Practical reforms suggested include clearer UI design, removal of default tip percentages, fixed‑amount or service‑charge alternatives, and non‑monetary thank‑you gestures.**  \n4. **While some still value tipping as a reward for excellent service, they generally prefer it in contexts where genuine, labor‑intensive service is provided (full‑service restaurants, delivery, etc.).**  \n\nOverall, the comments converge on the idea that the tipping system, as it currently stands, is overly intrusive and tied to systemic wage issues; most participants advocate for reforms that either eliminate mandatory tips or restructure compensation so that tips become a genuine expression of gratitude rather than a necessity for workers’ livelihoods.",
