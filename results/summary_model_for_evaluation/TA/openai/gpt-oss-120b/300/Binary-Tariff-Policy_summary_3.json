    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant view:** The overwhelming majority of respondents see the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society. Most argue that the tariffs act as a tax on consumers, pushing up the price of everyday goods, feeding inflation and eroding purchasing power.  \n\n- **Key concerns raised**\n  - **Higher consumer prices:** Nearly every comment mentions that tariffs are being passed on to shoppers, making food, gasoline, electronics and other essentials more expensive.\n  - **Pressure on small businesses:** Many note that small firms—especially those that rely on imported components or overseas suppliers—are being squeezed or forced to shut down.\n  - **Trade‑relationship damage:** A large share point to worsening diplomatic ties, retaliatory tariffs from other nations and a loss of the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.\n  - **Limited short‑term job gains:** While a few cite potential job creation in protected industries, most say any gains are modest, delayed, or outweighed by job losses in sectors dependent on global supply chains.\n  - **Uncertainty and volatility:** Respondents stress that the ad‑hoc nature of the tariffs creates business uncertainty, discourages investment and hampers long‑term planning.\n\n- **Minority perspectives on potential benefits**\n  - **Revenue generation:** A small segment highlights that tariff collections are boosting federal receipts and could, in theory, help reduce other taxes or fund public programs.\n  - **Domestic‑industry protection:** A handful of comments argue that tariffs could eventually revive U.S. manufacturing, reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and improve the trade balance.\n  - **Long‑run optimism:** A modest proportion (roughly 10‑15 %) believes that once the short‑run pain subsides, the policy might yield a net positive effect for the economy and for certain workers.\n\n- **Overall balance:** While a minority sees possible strategic or “long‑run” upside, the consensus is that the current tariff regime is producing immediate negative outcomes—higher prices, strained small businesses, and deteriorating trade relations—without clear evidence of compensating benefits. The sentiment leans heavily toward the view that the policy is detrimental in its present form.",
