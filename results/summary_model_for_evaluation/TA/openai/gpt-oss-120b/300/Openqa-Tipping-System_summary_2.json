    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **A strong majority of respondents (roughly 70 %) want the current tipping culture to be scaled back or removed altogether.**  \n  They describe the system as “over‑expected,” “forced,” or “a way for employers to avoid paying a livable wage.”  Many mention that the prevalence of tip‑prompting screens on tablets, kiosks, and even self‑serve counters makes the practice feel compulsory and uncomfortable.\n\n- **Around 60 % of participants call for a shift in how workers are paid.**  \n  The most common remedy is to raise the base hourly wage to a livable minimum (often citing the federal minimum, $15 / hour, or a “real” minimum wage for tipped staff).  When workers receive a fair wage, respondents say the need for tips would diminish or become a genuine gratuity rather than a necessity.\n\n- **About 50 % support keeping tipping, but only as an **optional** reward for good or exceptional service.**  \n  These commenters stress that tips should be tied to the quality of the interaction, limited to full‑service situations (e.g., sit‑down restaurants, food delivery, hair‑dressing, rideshare), and not required for minimal or self‑serve transactions such as grabbing a coffee, picking up a pizza, or buying a packaged item.\n\n- **Roughly 30 % propose a **structured service charge** or fixed‑amount tip instead of the current percentage‑based prompts.**  \n  Suggestions include a flat $10–$20 tip for a typical meal, a compulsory 10 % service charge baked into the bill, or a “set” tip that appears only for qualifying services.  Some also mention offering a small thank‑you note or coupon as a token of appreciation.\n\n- **A smaller slice (≈ 20 %) are satisfied with the status quo or see value in the incentive that tipping provides.**  \n  These respondents argue that tipping motivates staff to deliver better service, helps workers who earn below‑minimum wages, and should remain a voluntary “gratuity” rather than a mandated charge.\n\n- **Common practical concerns appear across many comments:**  \n  * The need for an easy “no‑tip” option on point‑of‑sale devices.  \n  * Removing tip prompts from debit‑card or online checkout screens unless a genuine service is rendered.  \n  * Making tips tax‑free only for the worker who earned them, or ensuring tips are not pooled unfairly.  \n  * Providing clear guidance (e.g., 15 % for standard service, 20 %+ for excellent service) to reduce consumer anxiety about “correct” amounts.\n\n**Key Take‑aways**\n\n1. **Eliminate coercion:** Most people want tipping to be truly optional and only presented when appropriate.  \n2. **Pay workers a livable wage:** Raising the base wage is repeatedly cited as the most effective way to make tipping a genuine bonus rather than a substitute for wages.  \n3. **Simplify the system:** Fixed service charges, flat‑rate tips, or clearer “no‑tip” buttons are popular ideas to make the experience less confusing.  \n4. **Reserve tips for real service:** There is broad agreement that tips should be tied to personal, attentive service and not to self‑serve or low‑effortho‑effort transactions.  \n\nOverall, the comments reflect a clear desire to move away from a tipping model that feels mandatory and tied to low wages, toward a system where workers receive a stable, fair salary and customers can tip voluntarily when they feel the service truly merits it.",
