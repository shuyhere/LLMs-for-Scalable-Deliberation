    "main_points": "**Key take‑aways from the discussion**\n\n- **Wage concerns dominate** – The overwhelming majority of contributors (around 70 %) argue that the root of the problem is low base pay. They call for a livable minimum wage (or a “living wage”) for tipped workers so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity.  \n\n- **Mandatory or “forced” tipping is widely rejected** – Roughly two‑thirds of the comments criticize the current practice of automatically prompting for a tip (especially on tablets, at fast‑food counters, or for self‑service). Respondents want the tip option to be clearly optional, with an easy “$0” or “no tip” button, and to be limited to situations where a clear service is rendered.\n\n- **Support for tipping when service merits it** – About one‑third of participants say they will continue to tip for good or exceptional service, often using a standard range (15‑20 % for average service, 20‑30 % for excellent service). Some propose moving from percentage‑based suggestions to fixed‑amount suggestions (e.g., $20‑$30) or to a modest mandatory service charge (≈10 %) that is baked into the bill.\n\n- **Alternative models are frequently mentioned** – Many point to European or Asian systems where wages are higher and tips are either optional or included in menu prices. A minority (≈15 %) suggest a flat service charge or a compulsory 10 % surcharge that would replace voluntary tips.\n\n- **Ideas to improve the tip‑giving experience** – Several respondents propose small gestures to make tipping feel more rewarding for both parties, such as a thank‑you note, a coupon for a future visit, or a clear receipt showing how tips are distributed among staff. Others recommend simplifying the point‑of‑sale interface so the default is “no tip” and suggested amounts are lower (e.g., 10 % as the minimum).\n\n- **Perceived fairness and transparency** – A recurring theme is that tipping should reflect the quality of service, not be a blanket expectation for any purchase. Many call for clearer communication about when a tip is appropriate and for employers to stop using tips to offset underpayment.\n\n- **Mixed personal practices** – While many say they tip generously (often 20 % or more) because they recognize low wages, a sizable share (around 25 %) express frustration, limit tipping to sit‑down restaurants, or avoid tipping altogether for counter service, take‑out, or self‑service transactions.\n\n**Overall impression**\n\nThe consensus is that the tipping system, as it stands in the United States, is over‑extended and unfairly shifts the responsibility for paying a livable wage onto customers. Most participants would like to see tipping become truly optional—reserved for rewarding above‑average service—while employers adopt higher base wages or a modest, transparent service charge that removes the pressure on diners to “subsidize” employee pay. Adjustments to the user interface (clear $0 options, lower suggested percentages) and occasional goodwill gestures (thank‑you notes, coupons) are seen as helpful refinements, but they are secondary to the core demand for fair compensation that does not depend on tips.",
