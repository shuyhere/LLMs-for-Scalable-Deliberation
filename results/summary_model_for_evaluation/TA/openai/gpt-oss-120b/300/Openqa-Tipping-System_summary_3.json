    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Wage‑related concerns dominate the discussion.** A large majority of respondents (around 70 %) argue that the root of the problem is that tipped workers are paid far below a livable wage. They repeatedly call for employers to raise base pay to at least a minimum‑wage level (or a true living wage) so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity.\n\n- **The pressure of mandatory or pre‑selected tip prompts is widely disliked.** About 60 % of comments criticize the way point‑of‑sale screens automatically prompting a tip (often before service is rendered) and suggest that a clear “no tip” option or the removal of the prompt for low‑service transactions (e.g., coffee counters, take‑out orders) would greatly improve the experience.\n\n- **Most people want tipping to be optional and tied to service quality.** Roughly 55 % say tips should be given only when the customer feels the service deserved it, and that the amount should reflect the quality of the interaction rather than a fixed percentage. Several participants propose moving from percentage‑based sliders to fixed‑amount suggestions (e.g., a $5‑$10 tip for a typical meal) or to a modest, uniform service charge (often cited at 10 % or 15 %) that can be added automatically and shared among staff.\n\n- **Support for a European‑style model appears in about 30 % of the responses.** These commenters favor a system where wages are sufficient and tips are either absent or merely a voluntary gratitude gesture, arguing that the practice would eliminate the need for customers to subsidize low wages.\n\n- **A smaller but notable segment (≈ 20 %) still values tipping as a positive incentive.** They view tips as a way to reward hard work, especially in full‑service restaurants, and would keep the practice unchanged except for making it less intrusive and ensuring that workers keep the full tip amount rather than having it pooled or taxed heavily.\n\n- **Creative improvements are occasionally suggested.** About 15 % of participants mention ideas such as giving customers a thank‑you note or a small coupon for tipping, providing a transparent breakdown of tip distribution, or allowing customers to select a “tip‑free” payment mode when they cannot afford extra charges.\n\n- **Overall sentiment:** The consensus leans strongly toward reforming the system so that employees receive a reliable, livable wage from their employers, with tipping relegated to an optional reward for exceptional service. The current model is seen as over‑extended, confusing, and unfairly shifting the responsibility for fair compensation from businesses to consumers.",
