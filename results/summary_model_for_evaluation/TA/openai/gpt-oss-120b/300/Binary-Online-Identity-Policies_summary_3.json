    "main_points": "**Key take‑aways from the deliberation**\n\n- **Privacy and safety dominate the opposition.**  \n  A large share of respondents (about **60 %**) view mandatory real‑name registration as a serious intrusion on personal privacy.  They cite risks such as data‑breaches, identity theft, doxxing, stalking, domestic‑abuse safety, and the potential for governments or corporations to misuse or sell personal information.  Many stress that anonymity is a core value of the internet and essential for vulnerable groups (whistle‑blowers, activists, survivors of abuse, minorities, etc.) to speak freely without fear of retaliation.\n\n- **Accountability and abuse‑reduction drive the support.**  \n  Roughly **30 %** of the comments favor real‑name policies because they believe it would increase accountability, curb cyber‑bullying, harassment, cat‑fishing, scams, bots, and misinformation.  Several participants note that linking posts to a verified identity could deter malicious behavior, protect minors, and make it easier to trace illegal activity (e.g., child exploitation, fraud, extremist content).\n\n- **Conditional or platform‑specific positions.**  \n  Around **10 %** adopt a nuanced stance: they would accept real‑name registration for certain contexts (professional networks, verified business pages, or age‑restricted services) while keeping it optional for leisure‑oriented platforms.  Some suggest a dual‑system where the platform retains a real‑name record for verification but allows users to display pseudonyms publicly.\n\n- **Common concerns across both sides**  \n  * **Enforcement feasibility:** Many doubt that any verification system could be reliably enforced without invasive ID checks, and worry that determined bad actors would simply create fake identities.  \n  * **Impact on free expression:** Both supporters and opponents acknowledge that anonymity can enable harmful speech, yet they differ on whether the trade‑off is justified.  \n  * **Data security:** Regardless of stance, respondents repeatedly mention the need for strong safeguards; even supporters who favor verification warn that poor security could amplify the harms they aim to prevent.\n\n- **Overall sentiment**  \n  The discussion reflects a clear tension between **privacy‑preserving anonymity** and **social‑media accountability**.  While a sizable minority sees real‑name registration as a practical tool against harassment and fraud, the majority view it as a disproportionate privacy violation that could endanger vulnerable users and stifle open discourse.  Most participants favor solutions that preserve choice—either optional verification, platform‑specific requirements, or a separate “verified” badge—rather than a universal, mandatory real‑name mandate.",
