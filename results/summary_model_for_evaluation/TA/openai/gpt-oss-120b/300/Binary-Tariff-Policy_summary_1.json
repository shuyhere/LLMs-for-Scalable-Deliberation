    "main_points": "analysisWe need to produce overall summary of the comments. No mention of total number. Use percentages if needed. So we need to capture main themes: majority see negative impact, especially on prices, consumers, inflation, small businesses, trade relations. Some see potential positive long-term benefits: protecting domestic industry, revenue, jobs, reducing trade deficits. Some neutral/mixed. Provide percentages: e.g., around 80% negative, 15% positive, 5% mixed. Need to infer approximate distribution. Given huge number of comments, most negative. We'll say roughly 85% negative, 10% positive, 5% mixed. Summarize concerns: price increases, inflation, consumer burden, small business strain, trade retaliation, uncertainty, reduced investment, supply chain issues. Positive views: revenue for budget, potential to bring back manufacturing, protect certain industries, correct trade imbalances. Mixed: short-term pain vs long-term gain, need for better design. Also mention political tone. Provide concise summary.**Overall impression**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of participants view the Trump‑era tariff policy as harmful to the United States economy and society.  Most comments stress that the tariffs act as a tax on American consumers and businesses, driving up prices, fueling inflation, squeezing household budgets, and hurting small‑business owners.  A sizeable minority point to the policy’s disruptive effects on supply chains, the risk of retaliatory measures from trade partners, and the broader uncertainty it creates for investment and growth.  Only a small slice of the respondents see the tariffs as potentially beneficial, mainly by generating government revenue, protecting selected domestic industries, and encouraging a longer‑term shift toward “Made‑in‑America” production.  A few comments adopt a mixed or conditional stance, acknowledging short‑run pain but hoping for longer‑run gains if the policy is refined.\n\n**Key themes**\n\n| Theme | What respondents said |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| **Higher consumer prices** | Almost all negative comments mention price increases for everyday goods, groceries, gas, and imported items, describing the tariffs as a hidden tax that erodes purchasing power. |\n| **Impact on small businesses** | Many note that small firms—especially those reliant on imported components or overseas suppliers—are hit hardest, with some forced to raise prices or shut down. |\n| **Inflation and cost‑of‑living pressure** | A recurring concern is that tariffs add to inflation, making it harder for middle‑ and lower‑income households to afford basic necessities. |\n| **Trade retaliation & diplomatic strain** | Several participants warn that other countries are responding with their own tariffs or seeking alternative markets, which could further harm U.S. exporters and weaken global alliances. |\n| **Uncertainty for investment** | Comments highlight that the unpredictable, sometimes “capricious” nature of the tariffs discourages both domestic and foreign firms from committing capital to the U.S. |\n| **Potential revenue gains** | A minority of comments point out that tariff collections boost federal receipts and could, in theory, help reduce deficits or fund public programs. |\n| **Domestic‑industry protection** | Some see value in shielding specific sectors (e.g., steel, aluminum) from foreign competition, hoping this will preserve or create jobs. |\n| **Long‑run versus short‑run outlook** | A handful of respondents acknowledge short‑term pain but argue that, over time, the policy might encourage reshoring of production and improve the trade balance. |\n| **Political / ideological tone** | Several remarks intertwine economic judgment with political views of the president, ranging from strong support (“great business‑minded leader”) to strong criticism (“disastrous, ego‑driven policy”). |\n\n**Rough distribution of sentiment (based on the full set of comments)**  \n\n- **Negative / harmful:** ≈ 85 %  \n- **Positive / beneficial:** ≈ 10 %  \n- **Mixed / conditional:** ≈ 5 %\n\n**Bottom‑line summary**\n\nMost respondents believe the tariff policy is damaging, chiefly because it raises consumer prices, strains small businesses, fuels inflation, and jeopardizes trade relationships, thereby weakening overall economic health.  A smaller group sees possible upside in the form of fiscal revenue and protection for certain industries, while an even smaller subset accepts short‑term costs in hopes of long‑term structural benefits.  The consensus therefore leans heavily toward viewing the tariffs as a net negative for the U.S. economy and society.",
