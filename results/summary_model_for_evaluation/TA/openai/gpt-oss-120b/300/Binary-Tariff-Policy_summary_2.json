    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **General Assessment** – The overwhelming majority of the comments view the tariff policy as harmful to the United States. Roughly **four‑fifths** of the respondents describe the impact as **negative**, while a smaller share (about **one‑fifth**) see any upside, either in the short‑term or over a longer horizon.\n\n- **Key Negative Themes**  \n  1. **Higher consumer prices and inflation** – Many participants note that tariffs act like a tax on imported goods, pushing retail prices up for everyday items, groceries, gasoline, and online purchases. This price pressure is described as eroding purchasing power, especially for middle‑ and lower‑income households.  \n  2. **Burden on small businesses** – Small firms that rely on imported components or finished products report tighter margins, higher operating costs, and in some cases the threat of closure.  \n  3. **Supply‑chain disruptions and shortages** – Respondents point to delayed shipments, reduced availability of certain goods, and the need for firms to re‑engineer supply chains, which adds uncertainty and cost.  \n  4. **Retaliatory measures and strained trade relationships** – Several comments highlight that other countries are responding with their own tariffs or seeking alternative trading partners, which could further hurt U.S. exporters and undermine diplomatic ties.  \n  5. **Questionable effectiveness for reshoring** – Critics argue that tariffs have not succeeded in bringing manufacturing back to the United States; many companies simply pass the cost on to consumers or shift production to other low‑tariff locations.  \n  6. **Political and procedural concerns** – Some participants criticize the policy as being driven more by political posturing than sound economics, noting its abrupt implementation and lack of legislative backing.\n\n- **Positive or Mixed Views**  \n  1. **Revenue generation and fiscal relief** – A minority of respondents mention that tariff collections are boosting federal revenue and could be used to reduce deficits or fund domestic programs.  \n  2. **Potential protection for specific industries** – A few see short‑term benefits for sectors such as steel, aluminum, or certain manufacturing jobs that receive temporary relief from foreign competition.  \n  3. **Long‑term strategic goals** – Some express optimism that, over time, the policy could encourage “Made‑in‑America” production, improve trade balances, and restore bargaining power with trade partners. These views often acknowledge short‑run pain (higher prices, adjustment costs) but expect eventual gains.  \n  4. **Mixed assessments** – Several comments acknowledge both costs and benefits, noting that the net effect may depend on how the tariffs are refined, how long they persist, and whether complementary policies (e.g., investment in domestic capacity) are added.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment** – While a small segment hopes that the tariffs will eventually correct perceived trade imbalances and fund government priorities, the dominant sentiment is that the policy is **raising costs for consumers, hurting small businesses, creating uncertainty, and damaging international trade relationships**. The prevailing view is that any potential long‑run benefits are outweighed by immediate economic pain and that the policy’s net impact is largely negative.",
