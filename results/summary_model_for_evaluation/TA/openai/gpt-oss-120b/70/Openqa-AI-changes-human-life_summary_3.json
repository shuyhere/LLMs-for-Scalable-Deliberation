    "main_points": "The comments paint a picture of AI as a powerful, everyday assistant that reshapes how people work, learn, create, and manage daily routines.  \n\n**Productivity and convenience** dominate the positive feedback. A large majority of respondents (around 70 %) say AI has streamlined repetitive tasks, accelerated research, and shortened the time needed for writing, data‑analysis, planning, and even household management. Many describe it as an “assistant” that can draft emails, generate proposals, summarize long articles, edit photos, and even help with homework or professional pricing. Users repeatedly note that AI makes information retrieval almost instantaneous, turning what used to be a multi‑step search into a single prompt.\n\n**Creativity and learning** are also highlighted. Roughly half of the participants mention that AI has opened new avenues for artistic expression (image generation, digital editing, music or video creation) and has acted as a tutor for technical subjects, language learning, and skill development. Several people point out that AI helps them brainstorm ideas for projects, home redesign, business strategies, or passive‑income concepts.\n\n**Mental‑health and emotional support** appear in a smaller but noticeable slice of the feedback (about 15 %). Some users appreciate AI chatbots for offering advice, reducing anxiety, or providing companionship when they feel isolated.\n\n**Concerns and negative impacts** are frequent and diverse. Approximately half of the comments raise worries about **privacy and data security**, noting that AI tracks searches, preferences, and personal details. **Job‑security anxiety** is expressed by a similar share, with users fearing automation could replace their roles. **Trust and authenticity** issues surface as well: many respondents feel more skeptical of online content, worry about deep‑fakes, and are uneasy about becoming overly dependent on AI for decision‑making or writing. A minority (around 10 %) describe AI as a source of distraction or addiction, especially in the context of social‑media feeds.\n\n**Balancing act** emerges as a central theme. While most people view AI as an indispensable tool that enhances efficiency and creativity, they simultaneously stress the need for **responsible use, regulation, and personal boundaries** to avoid over‑reliance, misinformation, and loss of critical thinking. The overall sentiment suggests that AI is reshaping daily life in largely beneficial ways, but its rapid integration brings legitimate ethical, occupational, and privacy challenges that users are beginning to grapple with.",
