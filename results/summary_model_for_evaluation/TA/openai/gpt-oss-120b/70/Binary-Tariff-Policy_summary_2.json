    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant perception:** The great majority of respondents see the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society.  \n  - Roughly **80 %** describe a **negative impact**, citing higher consumer prices, inflation, reduced spending power, and strain on small businesses.  \n  - About **15 %** express a **positive outlook**, focusing on short‑term revenue gains, potential budget‑deficit relief, and the hope that protectionism will eventually encourage reshoring of production.  \n  - The remaining **5 %** present a **mixed or conditional view**, acknowledging both costs and possible long‑run benefits.\n\n- **Key concerns driving the negative view**\n  1. **price increases** for everyday goods, which many say will be passed on to consumers and erode purchasing power.  \n  2. **Inflationary pressure** and the risk of a broader economic slowdown as higher costs curb consumer spending.  \n  3. **Small‑business vulnerability**, with owners reporting higher input costs, delayed shipments, and the threat of reduced profitability.  \n  4. **International retaliation** and deteriorating trade relationships, especially with China and other major partners, which could lead to reciprocal tariffs and further market instability.  \n  5. **Uncertainty for investors** and a perception that unpredictable, politically driven tariffs discourage long‑term capital allocation to the U.S.\n\n- **Positive arguments cited**\n  1. **Revenue generation**: Some participants note that tariffs are adding billions of dollars to the federal treasury, which could help lower the deficit.  \n  2. **Domestic industry protection**: A few believe that shielding certain sectors may preserve or create jobs over the long term.  \n  3. **Strategic leverage**: One view frames tariffs as a bargaining tool that could eventually force better trade deals for the United States.  \n  4. **Long‑run reshoring**: A minority expect that, once the policy stabilizes, higher import costs will make U.S. production more competitive and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains.\n\n- **Mixed or conditional perspectives**\n  - Some respondents acknowledge short‑term pain but hold out hope that the policy could narrow the trade deficit and improve fiscal balances over time.  \n  - A few point out that the actual impact may be limited because companies can circumvent tariffs, suggesting the net effect could be modest.\n\n- **Underlying sentiment**\n  - The overarching sentiment is **skepticism** toward the policy’s ability to deliver broad economic benefits, with most participants feeling that the costs—particularly to consumers and small businesses—outweigh the projected gains.  \n  - Even among the more optimistic voices, the optimism is often **conditional**, hinging on future adjustments, better trade negotiations, or a longer horizon for reshoring to take effect.",
