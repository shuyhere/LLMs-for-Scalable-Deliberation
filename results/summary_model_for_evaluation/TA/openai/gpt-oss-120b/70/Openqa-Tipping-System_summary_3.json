    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong consensus that the present tipping framework is overly intrusive and functions as a substitute for fair wages. A large majority of respondents (well over two‑thirds) argue that tips should be optional and tied to genuine service rather than presented as a default option on every transaction. Many point to point‑of‑sale screens that prompt a tip before service is rendered as a source of pressure and suggest redesigning these interfaces to make “no tip” clearly visible or to remove the prompt entirely for non‑service purchases (e.g., coffee‑to‑go, self‑serve items).\n\nA recurring theme is that employers should shoulder the responsibility for paying workers a livable wage. Around half of the participants explicitly call for a minimum‑wage guarantee (often citing $15 /hour) or a guaranteed base salary that would make tips unnecessary. Related proposals include replacing discretionary tips with a modest, transparent service charge (commonly 10 % in suggestions) or moving to a fixed‑amount tip model (e.g., a $20–$30 flat tip for a meal) to simplify the decision for customers.\n\nSeveral ideas aim to make tipping feel more rewarding rather than obligatory: offering a thank‑you note, a coupon for a future visit, or other small tokens to the customer who tips; limiting tipping to full‑service restaurant staff; or allowing customers to rate service before deciding on a tip. A minority of comments still endorse tipping as an incentive for exceptional service, but even these voices stress that it should not replace a fair wage.\n\nOverall, the sentiment is that the current system is an “out‑of‑hand” practice that enables businesses to underpay staff, creates confusion for consumers, and should be restructured so that compensation is primarily employer‑driven, with tipping retained only as a voluntary expression of gratitude for outstanding service.",
