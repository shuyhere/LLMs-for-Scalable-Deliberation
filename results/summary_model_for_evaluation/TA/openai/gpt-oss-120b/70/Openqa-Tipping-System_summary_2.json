    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Mandatory tipping is widely seen as problematic.**  \n  Most commenters (well over half) describe the current system as coercive, especially when tip prompts appear on point‑of‑sale screens for small or self‑service purchases. They argue that customers should not be forced or pressured to add a tip before any service is rendered.\n\n- **A fair, living wage is the preferred solution.**  \n  A large majority of participants (roughly 70 %) say the root of the issue is that many service workers are paid wages far below a livable level, so tips become a necessary supplement rather than a genuine reward. The common prescription is to raise the base hourly wage (often to at least the federal minimum or $15 / hour) and, in many cases, to replace tips with a modest, transparent service charge (e.g., 10 % or a fixed dollar amount).\n\n- **Tipping should be truly optional and tied to service quality.**  \n  About a third of the responses stress that tips should be given only when the service exceeds expectations. These commenters favor systems that let patrons decide the amount after they have experienced the service, or that limit tipping to situations where a clear, personal service is provided (e.g., sit‑down dining, not coffee pick‑up or fast‑food orders).\n\n- **Design of tip‑asking interfaces matters.**  \n  Numerous comments criticize intrusive tip‑menus that default to a non‑zero value or hide a “no tip” option. The suggested improvements include:  \n  * making the “no tip” button obvious and available on the initial screen,  \n  * presenting tip suggestions as optional rather than mandatory, and  \n  * only displaying tip prompts for transactions that involve direct, discretionary service.\n\n- **Cultural comparisons are frequently mentioned.**  \n  Several participants point to European or to Japan’s model, where employees receive a full wage and a modest service charge is added to the bill. They view these approaches as healthier for both workers and customers.\n\n- **Supporters of tipping see it as an incentive.**  \n  A minority (around 30 %) express that tipping, when voluntary and linked to good service, motivates staff to go above and beyond. Some suggest modest enhancements—such as a thank‑you note, a coupon, or a small fixed tip amount—to preserve the appreciative aspect without making it obligatory.\n\n- **Mixed feelings about tax and reporting.**  \n  A few comments note that tips are sometimes untaxed and argue that this can be an advantage for workers, though the broader consensus is that reliance on untaxed tips underscores the need for proper wages.\n\n- **Overall sentiment.**  \n  The dominant mood is one of frustration with a system that blurs the line between employee compensation and customer generosity. Most respondents envision a future where workers are paid a reliable wage, tipping is optional, and any extra contribution is presented transparently and only when genuine service warrants it.",
