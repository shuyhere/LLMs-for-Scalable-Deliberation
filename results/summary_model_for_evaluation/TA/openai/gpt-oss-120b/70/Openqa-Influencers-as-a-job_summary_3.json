    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe deliberation reveals a largely supportive stance toward internet influencers being recognised as a profession, tempered by notable reservations about authenticity, market saturation, and societal impact.\n\n**Positive perspectives (≈ 60 %)**  \n- **Economic opportunity:** Many participants appreciate that influencing offers a viable source of income, especially for those who can work from anywhere or turn a hobby into a livelihood.  \n- **Creative and entrepreneurial value:** Influencers are seen as modern‑day entertainers, marketers and small‑business owners who expand the creative labour market and democratise fame.  \n- **Information and entertainment:** A substantial share of comments highlight the role of influencers in delivering news, product reviews, tutorials and niche knowledge that traditional media often overlook.  \n- **Social relevance:** Influencers are recognised as trend‑setters who shape consumer behaviour, cultural narratives and even political discourse, filling a gap left by conventional outlets.  \n- **Accessibility:** The profession is praised for lowering entry barriers, allowing everyday people to build platforms, share personal stories and connect with audiences that feel more relatable than legacy celebrities.\n\n**Concerns and criticisms (≈ 30 %)**  \n- **Authenticity and trustworthiness:** A recurring worry is that many influencers appear inauthentic, chase trends, or prioritize sponsorships over genuine content, which can erode audience trust.  \n- **Oversaturation and quality dilution:** Participants note that the space is becoming crowded, leading to repetitive content, “copy‑cat” behaviour and a decline in originality.  \n- **Misinformation and responsibility:** There is unease about influencers being primary news sources for some viewers, potentially spreading unchecked or biased information.  \n- **Impact on youth and career expectations:** Several comments warn that the glamour of quick “easy money” may steer young people away from formal education or more stable career path, fostering unrealistic expectations.  \n- **Mental‑health and sustainability:** The pressure to constantly produce trending material is linked to creator burnout, mental‑health challenges, and a precarious reliance on algorithmic favour.\n\n**Neutral or mixed viewpoints (≈ 10 %)**  \n- Some respondents acknowledge both the benefits and drawbacks, suggesting that while the profession is legitimate, it should be treated as a side‑hustle rather than a primary career for most.  \n- A few see influencing as an evolution of earlier online content creation (e.g., YouTubers) and accept its status without strong endorsement or opposition.\n\n**Key Take‑aways**  \n- **Legitimacy is widely accepted** – most see influencer work as a genuine, modern profession that parallels other entertainment and media roles.  \n- **Calls for accountability** – many urge clearer standards, transparency about sponsorships, and greater responsibility toward audiences.  \n- **Balance between opportunity and risk** – the consensus underscores that while influencing opens new economic and creative doors, it also introduces challenges around quality, ethics, and long‑term viability.  \n\nOverall, the commentary paints a nuanced picture: internet influencing is celebrated for its innovative potential and economic promise, yet it is also scrutinised for its impact on information integrity, societal values, and the well‑being of both creators and consumers.",
