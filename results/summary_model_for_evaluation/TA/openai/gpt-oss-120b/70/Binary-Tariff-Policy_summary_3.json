    "main_points": "The discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of the current tariff policy.  \n\n- **Negative perception:** Roughly three‑quarters of the remarks describe the tariffs as harmful. The most common concerns are higher consumer prices, reduced purchasing power, and the way costs are passed from businesses to households. Commenters repeatedly note that small‑business owners are feeling the strain, that the policy is worsening inflation, and that it is damaging trade relationships—especially with China and other major partners. Many also argue that the tariffs erode U.S. soft power and could lead to retaliatory measures that further depress trade.\n\n- **Positive or hopeful views:** About one‑fifth of the contributors see potential benefits. These include the prospect of increased federal revenue, a future reduction in the trade deficit, and the idea that tariffs could eventually encourage reshoring of production and strengthen certain domestic industries. A few participants mention that, in the long run, the policy might help the U.S. economy once adjustment periods end.\n\n- **Mixed or nuanced opinions:** The remaining comments acknowledge both sides, suggesting that while tariffs may protect specific sectors, they also raise costs and create uncertainty that could slow investment and growth.\n\n**Key themes across the comments**\n\n1. **Price effects:** The dominant narrative is that tariffs act as a tax on imported goods, which businesses are likely to shift onto consumers, leading to higher everyday prices and reduced consumer spending.  \n2. **Impact on small businesses:** Numerous remarks highlight that small firms, which rely on imported inputs, are especially vulnerable, facing higher costs and supply‑chain disruptions.  \n3. **Trade relations:** Many express worry that the tariffs damage diplomatic and commercial ties, provoke retaliation, and undermine the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.  \n4. **Revenue vs. distribution:** While some point to the surge in tariff collections for the federal budget, most argue that the gains are not felt by ordinary Americans, who bear the price burden.  \n5. **Long‑term versus short‑term outcomes:** A recurring split is between short‑term pain (inflation, reduced spending, possible recession) and a hoped‑for long‑term payoff (more domestic manufacturing, a narrower trade deficit).  \n\nOverall, the consensus leans heavily toward a negative assessment of the tariff policy’s immediate impact on the U.S. economy and society, with only a modest portion of participants expressing optimism about longer‑term benefits.",
