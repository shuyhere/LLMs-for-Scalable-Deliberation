    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nThe overwhelming share of respondents (roughly 80 %) view the current U.S. tariff policy as detrimental to the economy and society.  The most frequently cited concerns are:\n\n* **Higher consumer prices** – many participants note that tariffs are passed on to shoppers, making everyday goods, groceries, and fuel more expensive and squeezing household budgets.  \n* **Strain on small‑businesses** – several comments describe difficulties for small firms that rely on imported inputs, leading to higher costs, reduced margins, or even the inability to source key products.  \n* **Deteriorating trade relationships** – a common theme is that tariffs provoke retaliation, damage diplomatic ties (especially with China), and undermine the United States’ reputation as a reliable trading partner.  \n* **Uncertainty and reduced investment** – businesses are reported to be hesitant to commit capital in an environment of unpredictable tariff moves, which could slow growth and innovation.  \n* **Potential recessionary pressure** ~) – the combination of higher prices and lower consumer spending is feared to drag the broader economy toward a slowdown.\n\nAbout one‑fifth of the comments (≈ 20 %) express a more optimistic or mixed outlook.  These participants point to:\n\n* **Revenue gains for the federal budget** – some see the tariff collections as a way to shrink the deficit or fund government programs.  \n* **Long‑term strategic benefits** – a few argue that, over time, tariffs could encourage reshoring of production, make U.S. industries more competitive, and reduce the trade deficit.  \n* **Limited short‑term impact** – a handful of respondents feel that the tariffs have not yet produced noticeable price hikes or import reductions, suggesting that the effects may be muted or temporary.  \n* **Positive signals for certain sectors** – a small number highlight that specific industries or investors who anticipate the policy correctly could profit.\n\nOverall, the consensus leans heavily toward a negative assessment, with price inflation for consumers and hardships for small businesses emerging as the dominant worries.  While a minority hold out hope for fiscal benefits or long‑run structural gains, most participants doubt that these potential upsides will outweigh the immediate costs and trade‑related risks.",
