    "main_points": "The comments reveal a broad consensus that health care should be treated as a basic right and that the government has a central role in guaranteeing at least minimal coverage for all citizens.  \n\n**Key arguments in favor (≈ 80 % of remarks)**  \n- **Moral and social justice:** Many respondents frame health insurance as a human right, emphasizing that no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities such as food or shelter.  \n- **Economic and national‑insecurity rationale:** A sizable share link universal coverage to a more productive workforce, lower medical‑debt‑driven bankruptcies, and even national‑security concerns, arguing that an unhealthy population undermines competitiveness.  \n- **Comparative evidence:** Several participants point to other developed nations (e.g., Canada, European countries) that already provide universal or public‑option systems and cite their relative success as a model for the United States.  \n- **Cost‑effectiveness for individuals and society:** The majority believe that a government‑run basic plan would reduce out‑of‑pocket expenses, prevent catastrophic debt, and ultimately lower overall health‑care spending by encouraging preventive care.  \n- **Desire for a public option or basic safety net:** Even among supporters, many call for a public alternative that co‑exists with private plans, ensuring choice while guaranteeing coverage for those who cannot afford private insurance.  \n\n**Reservations and opposition (≈ 15 % of remarks)**  \n- **Fiscal concerns:** Some respondents worry about the tax burden and the sustainability of a large‑scale public program.  \n- **Government efficiency and quality:** A minority argue that government delivery may be less efficient, could lower care quality, and might increase wait times.  \n- **Impact on private‑sector insurance:** A few fear that a universal baseline could crowd out private options or diminish incentives for innovation.  \n\n**Mixed or conditional positions (≈ 5 % of remarks)**  \n- Several comments support government‑provided basic coverage but stress the need for timely access, limited scope, or safeguards against excessive bureaucracy.  \n\nOverall, the narrative is dominated by strong support for government‑funded basic health insurance, framed as a moral imperative, an economic necessity, and a proven model abroad, while a smaller segment raises fiscal and efficiency worries.",
