    "main_points": "**Summary of the discussion on the tipping system**\n\n- **Broad dissatisfaction with mandatory tipping** – The overwhelming majority of contributors (≈ 70 %) view the current practice of presenting tip prompts for every transaction as intrusive, unfair, or coercive.  Common complaints focus on point‑of‑sale screens that push tips before service is rendered, the expectation to tip for minimal or self‑service purchases (e.g., coffee pick‑up, bottled water), and the perception that tipping has become a substitute for a proper wage.\n\n- **Calls for a living‑wage solution** – Roughly two‑thirds of the comments advocate that employers should pay a livable, minimum wage (often cited as $15 /hr or at least the federal minimum) so that workers no longer depend on tips for basic income.  Many tie this to the belief that tipping is a “scam” that lets businesses underpay staff.\n\n- **Preferred alternatives to the tip‑prompt model**  \n  - **Service charge or flat fee** – About 20 % suggest replacing discretionary tips with a modest, universal service charge (e.g., 10 % or a fixed $20‑$30 amount) that is automatically added to the bill, similar to practices in Japan or many European countries.  \n  - **Optional, gratitude‑based tipping** – A smaller share (≈ 10 %) would keep tipping but make it truly optional, perhaps rewarding only exceptional service and allowing customers to decide the amount without pre‑set percentages.  Ideas include fixed‑amount tips, thank‑you notes, or coupons as a token of appreciation.\n\n- **Support for tipping when service merits it** – A minority (≈ 15 %) express that tipping remains a useful incentive when service is genuinely good.  These respondents stress that tips should reflect performance, that they personally tip generously, and that they would continue to tip only in full‑service settings (restaurants, bars) rather than for self‑service or quick‑order transactions.\n\n- **Critiques of the current implementation** – Many comments highlight specific pain points:  \n  - Tip screens that are hard to set to “0 %” or that require multiple taps.  \n  - The cultural pressure to tip even for poor service.  \n  - The mismatch between low base wages (often $2.13 /hr for tipped workers) and reliance on tips.  \n  - The perception that tipping has been exported to non‑service contexts (e.g., donuts, drive‑throughs).\n\n- **Regional observations** – Several participants note that the U.S. is unique in its heavy reliance on tipping, contrasting it with European models where higher wages reduce or eliminate the need for tips.\n\n- **Overall sentiment** – The conversation converges on the view that the tipping system, as presently practiced, is broken and places undue burden on consumers while allowing employers to avoid fair compensation.  Most respondents favor either eliminating mandatory tip prompts or restructuring the system so that tips become a genuine, optional reward for outstanding service, coupled with a guaranteed livable wage for workers.",
