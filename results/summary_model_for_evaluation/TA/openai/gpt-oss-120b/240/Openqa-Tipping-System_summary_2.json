    "main_points": "analysisWe need to generate overall summary of comments, no mention of total numbers, use percentages when needed. Identify themes: many want to eliminate tipping, replace with livable wage, make tipping optional, reduce mandatory prompts, only for full-service, fix low wages, suggestion of service charge, European model, etc. Also some support tipping for good service, want fixed amounts, thank you notes, etc. Provide percentages: e.g., majority (around 70%?) want wages higher or tipping optional. We can approximate based on many comments. Use approximate percentages like \"roughly three‑quarters\" etc. Avoid exact counts. Provide balanced summary.\n\nLet's craft.**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Wage‑First Preference**  \n  A large majority of respondents (roughly three‑quarters) say the core problem is that many service workers are paid far below a livable wage. The most common suggestion is to raise the base hourly wage (or move to a salaried model) so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity. Several commenters point to the United‑States minimum‑wage system as the root cause and cite European or Asian models where wages are higher and tipping is optional or bundled into the price.\n\n- **Making Tipping Optional / Reducing Pressure**  \n  About two‑thirds of participants want tipping to be truly optional. They criticize the prevalence of pre‑selected tip buttons, “suggested‑percentage” prompts, and mandatory tip screens on tablets or payment terminals—especially for low‑service transactions such as coffee‑to‑go, pickup orders, or self‑service kiosks. The preferred changes include: a clear “0 %” or “no tip” button placed prominently, removal of default tip percentages, and limiting tip requests to situations where a server or delivery person provides full‑service assistance.\n\n- **Structure of the Tip Itself**  \n  Opinions on how tips should be calculated are mixed:  \n  * Around one‑third favor fixed‑amount or flat‑rate tips (e.g., a $5 minimum or a $20/$30 standard) rather than percentage‑based suggestions.  \n  * Another sizable group supports the current percentage model but wants the range to start lower (e.g., 10 % as a baseline) and to be clearly tied to service quality.  \n  * A small but vocal minority proposes replacing voluntary tips with a modest, mandatory service charge (often cited at about 10 %) that would be added to every bill and distributed to staff.\n\n- **Linking Tips to Service Quality**  \n  Most commenters who support retaining tips stress that they should be a reward for *good* or *exceptional* service, not a default part of the transaction. Many suggest that tip prompts should only appear after the service is rendered, and that customers should be free to adjust the amount based on their experience. Some also propose giving tangible thank‑you gestures (e.g., a note or coupon) alongside the tip, or ensuring that tips go directly to the individual who provided the service rather than being pooled indiscriminately.\n\n- **Cultural and Ethical Perspectives**  \n  Several participants view tipping as a cultural artifact that has become over‑extended in the U.S., noting that it is rarely practiced elsewhere. They argue that the current system places an unfair financial burden on customers and creates income instability for workers. Conversely, a minority of respondents see tipping as an essential way to recognize hard work and argue that it should remain, provided workers are otherwise compensated fairly.\n\n- **Key Desired Outcomes**  \n  1. **Fair, livable wages for all service staff** – the most frequently mentioned solution.  \n  2. **Voluntary, transparent tipping** – eliminate default or forced tip options, especially for low‑service interactions.  \n  3. **Simplified tip presentation** – clear “no tip” choices, optional prompts after service, and possibly a modest, uniform service charge as an alternative.  \n  4. **Alignment of tip amount with service quality** – tips should reflect the customer’s satisfaction rather than act as a built‑in surcharge.\n\nIn sum, the consensus leans strongly toward reforming the system so that tips are no longer a crutch for low wages, are truly optional, and are tied to the quality of service rendered. The suggested reforms range from raising wages and eliminating mandatory tip prompts to modest service‑charge models and clearer, service‑based tip structures.",
