    "main_points": "**Overall**\n\n- **Wage and Fair‑Pay Concerns** – The dominant thread is that many people see tipping as a stop‑gap for low wages. A large majority (well over half) argue that employers should pay a livable, minimum‑wage salary so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity. Several suggestions echo this sentiment: abolish the sub‑minimum “tipped” wage, raise the federal minimum wage, or replace tips with a flat service charge that is built into the menu price.\n\n- **Mandatory vs. Voluntary Tipping** – A strong portion of the comments (roughly two‑thirds) criticize the current practice of presenting tip options automatically on POS screens, especially for counter service, take‑out, or low‑effort transactions. Participants call for a clear “$0” or “no tip” button, or for tip prompts to appear only after a full‑service interaction. The preferred model is one where tipping is entirely optional and left to the customer’s judgment.\n\n- **Service‑Based Tipping** – Many respondents stress that tips should be tied to the quality of service. They propose:\n  * Fixed amounts (e.g., a $5 minimum or a set $20–$30 tip for larger‑ticket bills) rather than percentage sliders.\n  * A tiered or “good‑service‑only” approach, where tips are given for sit‑down restaurants, delivery, or any role that involves personal interaction, but not for self‑service, coffee‑grab, or grocery checkout.\n  * Optional gratitude gestures such as thank‑you notes, coupons, or small tokens rather than a required monetary add‑on.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons** – A notable share of the discussion references European or Asian models where service is included in the price and tipping is rare. Participants suggest adopting a similar system in the United States, either by embedding a modest service charge (e.g., 10 %) or by raising menu prices to cover fair wages.\n\n- **Support for the Existing System** – A smaller segment (around one‑quarter) expresses satisfaction with tipping as a way to reward good work, especially in restaurants, bars, delivery, or personal‑service jobs (hair‑dressers, drivers). Some of these commenters propose modest tweaks—such as lowering default percentage options, making the “no tip” choice more visible, or keeping tips tax‑free—rather than a wholesale overhaul.\n\n- **Emotional Reactions** – The tone ranges from frustration (“fe​eling bullied into tipping,” “tipping is out of hand”) to appreciation (“tipping feels like recognition for hard work”). Many describe tipping as a “necessary evil” that would disappear if wages were fair, while others view it as an ingrained part of hospitality culture that should remain optional but respected.\n\n**Overall Takeaway**  \nThe consensus leans heavily toward reform: eliminate forced or pre‑selected tip prompts, ensure employees receive a livable wage, and re‑position tips as an optional reward for exceptional service. A minority still values the current system but would like it simplified and less intrusive. The overarching goal across the comments is a tipping environment that respects both workers’ need for fair compensation and customers’ freedom to tip only when they deem the service worthy.",
