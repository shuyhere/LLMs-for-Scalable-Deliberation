    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant perception:** The overwhelming majority of participants view the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society.  \n  - Roughly **four‑fifths** of the comments stress that tariffs raise the price of imported goods, squeeze household budgets, and fuel inflation.  \n  - Many note that the higher costs are passed on to consumers, hurting low‑ and middle‑income families and reducing overall consumer spending.  \n\n- **Key concerns among the negative view:**  \n  - **Higher consumer prices** and reduced purchasing power are repeatedly cited as the most immediate impact.  \n  - **Small‑business strain** – owners report tighter margins, disrupted supply chains, and in some cases, the inability to source affordable inputs.  \n  - **Trade‑partner retaliation** – several respondents warn that other countries are imposing their own duties, threatening U.S. export markets and diplomatic relations.  \n  - **Uncertainty and investment slowdown** – erratic tariff changes are said to discourage corporate investment and long‑term planning.  \n  - **Limited job‑creation evidence** – while some expect job gains, many argue that any benefits are modest, uneven, and offset by job losses in sectors dependent on imported components.\n\n- **Positive or hopeful perspectives:** About **one‑sixth** of the comments highlight potential advantages.  \n  - **Revenue generation** – a few note that tariff receipts could improve the federal budget and reduce deficits.  \n  - **Domestic industry protection** – some believe tariffs could shield certain manufacturers, encouraging reshoring of production over the long run.  \n  - **Strategic leverage** – a minority sees tariffs as a bargaining tool to compel fairer trade terms from partners that have historically “taken advantage” of the U.S.\n\n- **Mixed or conditional views:** A small slice (≈ 5 %) acknowledges both pros and cons, suggesting that short‑term pain (price spikes, supply‑chain disruptions) might be offset by longer‑term gains such as stronger negotiating positions or eventual job growth if the policy is sustained and refined.\n\n- **Overall sentiment:** The consensus leans heavily toward a **negative impact**, with most respondents emphasizing immediate consumer hardships and broader economic drag, while a modest minority remains optimistic about fiscal benefits or future industrial gains.",
