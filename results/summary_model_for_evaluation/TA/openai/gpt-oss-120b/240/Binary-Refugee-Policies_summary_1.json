    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Deliberation Comments**\n\n- **Broad Support (≈ 60 % of respondents)**  \n  The majority of participants expressed a clear willingness to admit more refugees fleeing war or persecution.  Their arguments fell into three main strands:  \n  * **Humanitarian/Moral duty** – many framed acceptance as a moral imperative, a reflection of American values of freedom, democracy and compassion, and a way to “do the right thing” for people in life‑threatening danger.  \n  * **Historical identity** – several commenters pointed to the United States’ own founding story as a nation built by people escaping oppression, and argued that continuing this tradition is essential to the country’s character.  \n  * **Potential benefits** – a subset highlighted possible economic, cultural and demographic gains (e.g., revitalizing rural areas, adding skilled workers, fostering diversity) that refugees can bring when properly integrated.\n\n- **Conditional or Qualified Support (≈ 20 % of respondents)**  \n  Many supporters stressed that acceptance should be **tied to robust vetting and limits**:  \n  * **Security screening** – calls for thorough background checks to prevent entry of individuals with criminal or terrorist ties.  \n  * **Capacity limits** – suggestions that the number of refugees be capped or phased in so that public services, housing, schools and health care are not overwhelmed.  \n  * **Integration measures** – recommendations for sponsorship programs, language and civic education, and placement in communities that can absorb newcomers.  \n  * **Shared responsibility** – some urged that the U.S. should not bear the burden alone, advocating for greater involvement from other wealthy nations.\n\n- **Opposition (≈ 15 % of respondents)**  \n  Those against expanding refugee admissions raised concerns centered on:  \n  * **Economic strain** – fears that additional refugees would increase government spending, exacerbate debt, and compete with American citizens for jobs, housing, and social benefits.  \n  * **Systemic overload** – arguments that the current immigration and asylum system is already broken, and adding more cases would worsen backlogs and reduce overall effectiveness.  \n  * **Cultural and security worries** – worries that large influxes could lead to social tension, higher crime rates, or dilute American cultural cohesion.  \n  * **Prioritizing domestic needs** – a belief that the government should first address the hardships of U.S. citizens before extending aid abroad.\n\n- **Neutral / Mixed Views (≈ 5 % of respondents)**  \n  A small segment expressed ambivalence, acknowledging both the humanitarian case and the practical challenges, and often called for more data or a pause until the immigration system is reformed.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n1. **Humanitarian sentiment dominates** – most participants see refugee protection as aligned with core U.S. values.  \n2. **Practical safeguards are widely demanded** – even strong supporters want clear vetting, caps, and integration plans to mitigate perceived risks.  \n3. **Economic and capacity concerns fuel opposition** – the primary reasons for rejecting more refugees relate to fiscal pressure and the strain on public services.  \n4. **Consensus on the need for a balanced approach** – across the spectrum, there is a common call for policies that marry moral responsibility with realistic limits and shared international effort.",
