    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Support (≈ 70 %)**  \n  A large majority expressed clear backing for the United States to accept more refugees fleeing war or persecution.  The most common reasons cited were humanitarian duty, moral responsibility, America’s founding story as a refuge for the oppressed, and the belief that refugees can enrich the nation culturally and economically.  Many also linked acceptance to the U.S.’s role in global affairs—arguing that when U.S. policies have contributed to conflicts, the country has an added obligation to help the victims.\n\n- **Conditional or Qualified Support (≈ 20 %)**  \n  A substantial share of respondents were willing to accept refugees but only under specific safeguards.  The recurring conditions included:  \n\n  * **Rigorous vetting and background checks** to prevent security threats or criminal elements.  \n  * **Limits or caps** on the number of refugees to avoid overwhelming public services.  \n  * **Prioritization** of genuine war‑or‑persecution cases over economic migrants, and sometimes a focus on certain age or skill groups.  \n  * **Geographic distribution** (e.g., placing newcomers in less‑populated areas or sharing the burden with other countries).  \n\n  These participants generally framed their stance as “support with responsible management.”\n\n- **Opposition (≈ 10 %)**  \n  Those opposed to expanding refugee admissions highlighted several concerns:  \n\n  * **Economic strain** – the U.S. debt, budget deficits, and competition for jobs, housing, and social services.  \n  * **Existing immigration pressures** – a belief that the current system is already overloaded with undocumented migrants and that resources should first address domestic needs.  \n  * **Security worries** – fear that insufficient screening could let in criminals or terrorists.  \n  * **Political or cultural resistance** – some expressed that newcomers could alter the cultural fabric or that the country should prioritize its own citizens.\n\n- **Neutral or Uncertain (≈ 5 %)**  \n  A small group expressed ambivalence, saying they understood both sides but lacked a firm position, often citing limited personal knowledge or the complexity of the issue.\n\n**Key Themes Across All Comments**\n\n1. **Humanitarianism vs. Practical Constraints** – The debate consistently balanced compassion for people in danger against pragmatic concerns about resources, security, and system capacity.  \n2. **Moral Identity** – Many invoked the United States’ historical image as a “land of opportunity” and a beacon of freedom, while opponents stressed the need to protect current citizens first.  \n3. **Policy Design** – There was strong consensus that any expansion should be accompanied by transparent, fair, and thorough vetting processes, clear limits, and possibly international cost‑sharing.  \n4. **Economic Impact** – Supporters often argued that refugees can become productive contributors, whereas detractors focused on immediate fiscal and social costs.  \n5. **Responsibility Linked to Foreign Policy** – Several comments linked acceptance to accountability for U.S. involvement in the conflicts that generate refugees.  \n\nOverall, while a clear majority favors accepting more refugees, most of them call for a structured, vetted, and limited approach to balance humanitarian goals with domestic considerations.",
