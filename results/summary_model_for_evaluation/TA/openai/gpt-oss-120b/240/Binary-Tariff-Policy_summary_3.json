    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Perceived Impact** – The overwhelming majority of respondents view the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society. Roughly **four‑fifths** of the comments describe a **negative** effect, while only about **one‑tenth** see a **positive** outcome and the remaining few describe a **mixed or uncertain** impact.\n\n- **Key Concerns**\n  - **Higher Consumer Prices & Inflation** – Almost every comment that flags a negative impact points to rising prices for everyday goods, increased cost of living, and inflationary pressure on household budgets.\n  - **Small‑Business Strain** – Many participants note that tariffs raise input costs for small firms, squeeze profit margins, and in some cases threaten viability.\n  - **Trade Relations & Retaliation** – A sizable share warns that tariffs damage diplomatic and commercial ties, provoke retaliatory measures from other countries, and erode the U.S.’s reputation as a reliable trading partner.\n  - **Uncertainty & Investment** – Several remarks highlight that the unpredictable nature of the tariffs discourages domestic and foreign investment and creates broader economic uncertainty.\n  - **Limited Job Creation** – While a few respondents argue that tariffs could protect or create jobs in certain sectors, most contend that any such gains are modest, delayed, or outweighed by broader economic costs.\n\n- **Potential Benefits Cited**\n  - **Revenue Generation** – Some commenters point to the additional tariff revenue that could improve the federal budget or fund domestic programs.\n  - **Domestic Industry Protection** – A minority believe tariffs can shield specific industries (e.g., steel, aluminum) and eventually encourage reshoring of production.\n  - **Long‑Term Strategic Gains** – A few suggest that short‑term pain might lead to longer‑term benefits such as reduced trade deficits, stronger negotiating positions, or a more self‑reliant manufacturing base.\n\n- **Temporal Perspectives**\n  - **Short‑Term View** – The dominant sentiment is that the immediate effect is a **price increase** and **economic slowdown**.\n  - **Long‑Term Outlook** – Views are split: some envision eventual gains from a more protected domestic sector, while most remain skeptical that long‑run benefits will materialize or outweigh the costs.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment** – The collective narrative paints the tariff policy as a **tax on consumers** that raises living costs, harms small businesses, and strains international relationships, with only limited and contested evidence of fiscal or strategic upside. The few optimistic voices tend to focus on potential revenue and future industrial benefits, but these are far outnumbered by concerns about inflation, reduced purchasing power, and broader economic instability.",
