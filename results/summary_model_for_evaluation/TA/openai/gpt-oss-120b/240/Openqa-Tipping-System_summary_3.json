    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Consensus on Reform**  \n  A large majority of respondents feel that the current tipping system is **over‑expanded** and often **forced** rather than voluntary. Many describe it as an “expectation” that now appears in situations where little or no service is provided (e.g., coffee‑to‑go, fast‑food counters, self‑service kiosks).  \n\n- **Core Criticisms**  \n  1. **Pressure and Invisibility** – The prevalence of tablet/online tip prompts, pre‑selected percentages, and “no‑tip” options that are hard to find make customers feel **obligated** or **bullying**.  \n  2. **Unequal Compensation** – Workers in many service roles receive **sub‑minimum wages** (often the federal $2.13 tip credit), forcing them to rely on tips to make a livable income.  \n  3. **Inconsistent Application** – Tipping is expected across a wide range of businesses, from full‑service restaurants to grocery checkout clerks, which many view as **unfair**.  \n\n- **Preferred Directions for Change**  \n  - **Make tipping truly optional** and restrict it to situations where a clear, personal service is rendered (e.g., sit‑down restaurant servers, delivery drivers, hair‑dressers).  \n  - **Replace mandatory tipping with a fixed service charge** or a modest, transparent surcharge (often suggested around 10 % – 15 %) that is included in the menu price, thereby removing the need for on‑screen prompts.  \n  - **Raise the base wage** for tipped workers to a **livable minimum** (many advocate for at least $15 /hour). When wages are adequate, tips become a **bonus** rather than a necessity.  \n  - **Improve tip presentation** – provide a clear “$0” or “no tip” button as the default, eliminate intrusive pop‑ups, and optionally offer a thank‑you note or small token (e.g., a coupon) for those who do tip.  \n  - **Standardize tip amounts** – some suggest moving from percentage‑based calculations to **fixed dollar amounts** (e.g., $20‑$30 for a typical dinner) or a tiered system (low‑cost meals ≈ $5, higher‑end meals ≈ $20).  \n\n- **Supportive Views**  \n  Around a quarter of the comments **affirm the value of tipping** when it rewards **exceptional service** and acknowledges workers’ effort. These respondents typically tip 15 % – 25 % in full‑service settings and would keep the practice as long as it remains **voluntary** and **not tied to low wages**.  \n\n- **Cultural Comparisons**  \n  Several participants point to **European models** where employees receive a fair wage and tipping is either minimal or built into the price. This is cited as an illustration of a system that **eliminates the need for compulsory tips**.  \n\n- **Emerging Ideas**  \n  - Offering **non‑monetary thank‑you gestures** (notes, coupons) alongside tips.  \n  - Using **service‑charge models** common in other countries (e.g., a flat 10 % charge).  \n  - Implementing **transparent tip‑distribution policies** so workers understand how tips are shared.  \n\n**Key Takeaway**  \nThe dominant sentiment is that tipping should be **optional, limited to genuine service encounters, and decoupled from workers’ basic compensation**. Most participants call for **higher base wages** and **simpler, less intrusive tip interfaces**, while a smaller but notable group continues to support tipping as a voluntary reward for good service.",
