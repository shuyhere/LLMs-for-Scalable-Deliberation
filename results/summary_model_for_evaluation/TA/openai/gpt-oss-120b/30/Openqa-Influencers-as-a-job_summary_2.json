    "main_points": "The comments paint a largely supportive picture of internet influencing as a legitimate career, while also flagging several recurring worries.\n\n**Broad sentiment**  \n- Around **60 %** of the remarks are positive or at least accepting, highlighting the profession’s appeal, its capacity to generate income, and its role in delivering entertainment, information, and niche‑specific recommendations.  \n- Roughly **20 %** of the responses focus on concerns—chiefly about authenticity, oversaturation, and the potential for influencers to spread misleading ideas or to become “fake.”  \n- About **15 %** adopt a neutral or mixed tone, acknowledging both the opportunities and the drawbacks without taking a firm side.  \n- A smaller slice, **≈10 %**, expresses outright dislike or skepticism, describing influencers as annoying, inauthentic, or a symptom of a “Tower of Babel‑like” fragmentation of culture.\n\n**Key themes**\n\n1. **Recognition as a profession**  \n   - Many commenters note that the rise of influencers mirrors past media shifts (e.g., the emergence of TV personalities or 1990s celebrities) and reflects a natural evolution of how audiences consume content and make purchasing decisions.  \n   - The COVID‑19 lockdown period is frequently cited as a catalyst that accelerated the profession’s visibility and legitimacy.\n\n2. **Economic opportunity**  \n   - A strong majority point out that influencing offers a flexible, home‑based way to earn a living, with some individuals achieving “very good” or “good” incomes.  \n   - The notion that influencing can supplement or even replace traditional jobs appears repeatedly.\n\n3. **Value to audiences**  \n   - Several remarks praise influencers for delivering entertainment, niche knowledge, and alternative news that can be more immediate or relatable than mainstream outlets.  \n   - The ability of everyday people to build personal brands and reach diverse audiences is celebrated as a democratic expansion of media.\n\n4. **Responsibility and authenticity**  \n   - A recurring call for accountability surfaces: influencers should be mindful of their impact on followers, avoid spreading misinformation, and act responsibly—especially because the field lacks formal regulation.  \n   - Critics worry that many creators chase trends, produce homogeneous content, or resort to sensationalism to capture views, which can dilute originality and authenticity.\n\n5. **Oversaturation and cultural effects**  \n   - Comments describe the market as “crowded,” “saturated,” or “depressing,” noting that the sheer volume of influencers can make it hard for audiences to discern quality or for creators to remain unique.  \n   - Some liken the phenomenon to a cultural fragmentation, where multiple personal “brands” compete for attention, potentially eroding shared understanding.\n\n6. **Educational perspective**  \n   - One viewpoint cautions that while influencing can be lucrative, young people should still be encouraged to pursue formal education or trade skills rather than rely solely on “easy money” from the internet.\n\n**Overall picture**  \nThe collective feedback suggests that most people view internet influencing as a valid, modern profession that opens new pathways for income, creativity, and information sharing. At the same time, there is a notable undercurrent concern about authenticity, market saturation, and the need for greater accountability to ensure the sector contributes positively to society.",
