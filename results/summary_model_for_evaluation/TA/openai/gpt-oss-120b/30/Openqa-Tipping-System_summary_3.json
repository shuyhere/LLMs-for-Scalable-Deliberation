    "main_points": "The discussion reveals a strong consensus that the prevailing tipping model in the United States places undue pressure on diners and unfairly shifts the burden of a livable wage onto employees. Roughly four‑in‑ten participants call for the elimination of mandatory or “default” tip prompts and argue that businesses should instead guarantee a decent base salary for service staff. Many of these voices also note that the current system enables employers to underpay workers, and they point to European models where tipping is optional or nonexistent as a preferable alternative.\n\nA comparable share of respondents supports retaining tipping as a voluntary gesture that rewards genuinely good service. These contributors suggest a range of improvements: shifting from percentage‑based calculations to fixed‑amount suggestions, providing tangible acknowledgments such as thank‑you notes or coupons, and ensuring that a “no‑tip” option is clearly visible on point‑of‑sale screens. A minority proposes institutionalising a modest, mandatory service charge (e.g., a flat 10 %) that would be added to every bill, thereby decoupling tip decisions from the payment process.\n\nSeveral comments highlight how modern tablet‑based checkout systems have amplified the perception of coercion, making it difficult for customers to decline a tip without multiple taps. Participants advocate for UI changes that place a zero‑percent option front‑and‑center or that only present tipping prompts after a service has been rendered.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that tipping in its current form is over‑expected, especially for low‑value transactions such as take‑out orders or self‑service scenarios. While a smaller slice of the group still views tipping positively when it reflects exceptional effort, the dominant narrative calls for systemic reform: either by removing compulsory tipping entirely and instituting guaranteed wages, or by making any gratuity truly optional and clearly linked to service quality.",
