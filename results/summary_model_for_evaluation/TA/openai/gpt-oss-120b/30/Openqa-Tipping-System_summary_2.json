    "main_points": "Most of the feedback calls for a fundamental shift away from the current, often‑mandatory, the‑tip‑at‑checkout model. Roughly three‑quarters of the respondents argue that tipping should no longer be imposed on customers; they would rather see workers receive a livable base wage or a fixed service charge that is built into the bill. Many of these comments also note that the practice is used by employers to avoid paying proper wages, that point‑of‑sale tablets make “no‑tip” selections awkward, and that the system feels coercive, especially for low‑value transactions such as pick‑up orders.\n\nA smaller but still notable share (about one‑fifth) supports tipping in principle but wants it to be truly optional and tied to the quality of service. These participants suggest that tips should be given only when the service exceeds expectations, that the amount could be expressed as a fixed dollar figure rather than a percentage, and that customers could receive a small token of appreciation—such as a thank‑you note or a coupon—for their generosity.\n\nA minority of comments (around ten percent) focus on practical tweaks to the existing framework rather than a complete overhaul. Ideas include standardising tip amounts for different purchase levels, making “no tip” an obvious first‑screen option on digital menus, and offering non‑monetary rewards to acknowledge good service. Overall, the consensus leans strongly toward eliminating compulsory tipping and ensuring that workers are compensated through stable wages or transparent service charges, while preserving the ability for customers to reward exceptional service on a voluntary basis.",
