    "main_points": "The overwhelming impression from the deliberation is that most respondents believe the current tariff policy will hurt the U.S. economy. Roughly two‑thirds of the comments stress negative consequences, highlighting higher consumer prices, rising inflation, squeezed small‑business margins, and deteriorating trade relationships—especially with China. Many argue that firms will pass tariff costs onto shoppers, curbing household spending and potentially pushing the broader economy toward recession. A similar share points out that the policy offers little immediate benefit, noting that foreign producers can still supply cheaper goods, that companies are finding ways to sidestep the duties, and that the tariffs may damage the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.\n\nAbout one‑sixth of the remarks adopt a more optimistic tone, emphasizing potential long‑term gains. Proponents cite additional federal revenue, the prospect of protecting strategic domestic industries, and the possibility of reducing the nation’s reliance on foreign imports, which they argue could eventually lift workers out of poverty and stabilize the fiscal outlook.\n\nThe remaining roughly one‑sixth present mixed or nuanced views. These participants acknowledge short‑term pain—higher prices and adjustment costs—but suggest that the tariffs could yield benefits over time, such as bolstering specific sectors, encouraging reshoring, or rewarding investors who anticipate market shifts. Some also note uncertainty about the overall impact, pointing to limited evidence of price changes in certain markets and the difficulty of predicting long‑run outcomes.\n\nKey themes across the discussion include:\n\n* **Consumer impact:** The dominant concern is that tariffs increase the cost of everyday goods, eroding purchasing power for middle‑ and lower‑income households.\n* **Business and industry effects:** Small businesses are seen as especially vulnerable, while larger firms may either absorb costs, shift production abroad, or exploit loopholes.\n* **Trade relations:** Respondents frequently mention strained diplomatic ties and the risk of retaliation from trading partners.\n* **Fiscal considerations:** A minority highlight the boost to federal revenues, though others question whether the gains outweigh the broader economic drag.\n* **Long‑term versus short‑term outlook:** Optimists focus on strategic, future‑oriented benefits, whereas skeptics stress immediate drawbacks and the uncertainty of any delayed payoff.\n\nOverall, the consensus leans heavily toward a negative assessment of the tariff policy’s current economic impact, with a smaller but notable segment hoping for eventual advantages and a portion remaining ambivalent about its net effect.",
