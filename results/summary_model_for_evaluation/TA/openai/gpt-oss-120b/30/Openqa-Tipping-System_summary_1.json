    "main_points": "The discussion reveals a strong consensus that the present tipping model feels coercive and tied to low base wages. A large majority of respondents (well over half) argue that tips should be optional and that employees in service roles ought to receive a livable, minimum‑wage salary so that tips become a genuine gratuity rather than a necessary supplement.  \n\nSeveral participants propose concrete alternatives:  \n* **Mandatory service charge** – replacing discretionary tips with a fixed percentage (often suggested around 10 %) that is automatically added to every bill, while still allowing an optional tip for exceptional service.  \n* **Fixed‑amount tips** – moving away from percentage‑based calculations toward set dollar amounts (e.g., $20‑$30) that would simplify the process and reduce pressure on low‑ticket transactions.  \n* **Reward for tipping** – offering a small token such as a thank‑you note or a coupon to acknowledge the customer’s contribution.  \n\nTechnology and presentation are also a recurring concern. Many feel that point‑of‑sale screens push tips aggressively, making a “no‑tip” option hard to find and prompting tips before service is rendered. Respondents suggest redesigning the interface so that a zero‑tip button is prominent and tips can only be entered after the service has been evaluated.\n\nWhile the dominant view is critical of the current system, a notable minority still support tipping when it reflects genuine appreciation for good service. These contributors emphasize that servers perform demanding work and that a voluntary tip can be a meaningful reward, especially when the tip is not taxed.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment calls for a shift from a culture of implied or mandatory tipping toward a framework where employees receive reliable wages and tips remain a voluntary expression of gratitude, facilitated by clearer, less intrusive payment interfaces.",
