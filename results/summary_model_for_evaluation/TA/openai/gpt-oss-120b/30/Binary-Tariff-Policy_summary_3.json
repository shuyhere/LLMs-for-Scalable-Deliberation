    "main_points": "The overall impression of the deliberation is that most participants view the current U.S. tariff policy as harmful to the economy. A large majority—roughly three‑quarters of the comments—highlight rising consumer prices, higher inflation, and reduced purchasing power as the most immediate and tangible effects. Many point to small‑business strain, increased costs for everyday goods, and the likelihood that firms will pass tariff expenses onto shoppers. Concerns are also voiced about deteriorating trade relationships, especially with China, and the risk that the United States could become more isolated in global markets.\n\nA smaller share of the remarks—around one‑quarter—express a more optimistic outlook. These participants argue that tariffs could generate substantial federal revenue, protect certain domestic industries, and eventually improve the trade balance. Some suggest that, over the long run, the policy might help reshape the economy, encourage reshoring, or benefit investors who can time market reactions correctly. However, even the more positive comments often acknowledge short‑term pain or note that any gains would be limited to specific sectors or groups.\n\nAcross the spectrum, several recurring themes emerge:\n\n* **Consumer Impact:** The dominant sentiment is that tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which in turn raises overall living expenses and suppresses consumer spending.\n* **Business Effects:** Small firms are seen as especially vulnerable, while larger companies may seek ways to circumvent the duties, limiting the policy’s effectiveness.\n* **Trade Relations:** Many participants worry that the tariffs damage diplomatic and commercial ties, prompting retaliatory measures from other countries.\n* **Economic Uncertainty:** There is a shared apprehension that the tariffs contribute to an uncertain investment climate, potentially slowing growth and heightening recession risk.\n* **Revenue vs. Cost:** Pro‑tariff voices focus on the fiscal boost from tariff collections, but they often concede that the broader economic costs may outweigh these gains.\n\nIn sum, the consensus leans heavily toward a negative assessment of the tariff policy’s impact on the U.S. economy, with only a modest portion of respondents seeing potential long‑term or sector‑specific benefits.",
