    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe comments reveal a largely favorable view of AI’s impact on daily life, with the majority of respondents describing concrete benefits. Most people highlight how AI streamlines routine and work‑related tasks—such as drafting emails, creating tables, summarising articles, and conducting research—allowing them to finish projects faster and free up time for other activities. This boost in efficiency is linked to feelings of increased productivity, reduced stress, and a sense that AI has become an indispensable personal assistant.\n\nEducational and creative uses also surface strongly. Many users report that AI helps them learn new subjects, complete homework, improve writing, and generate ideas for art, design, home‑renovation, or passive‑income projects. The technology is praised for turning vague concepts into visual drafts or polished content, making artistic expression more accessible for those who previously struggled.\n\nA noticeable minority of participants express reservations. Concerns cluster around privacy (tracking of searches and personal preferences), data security, and the potential for AI‑generated content to erode trust in other people’s work. Some worry about job displacement or feel anxious about the pervasive presence of AI in creative fields. A few respondents describe AI as an optional tool that has not materially changed their lives, or even as something they deliberately avoid because they view it as a form of theft.\n\nOverall, roughly sixty percent of the feedback emphasizes positive, productivity‑driven outcomes, about thirty percent combines both benefits and drawbacks—particularly around privacy and trust—and the remaining ten percent are neutral or skeptical about AI’s personal relevance. The prevailing sentiment is that AI has become a valuable, time‑saving assistant, while ongoing debates about privacy, authenticity, and societal impact temper the enthusiasm.",
