    "main_points": "Overall, the comments paint a picture of AI as a powerful, everyday assistant that reshapes how people work, learn, and create.  \n\n**Productivity and efficiency** dominate the positive feedback. Roughly three‑quarters of the respondents highlight how AI speeds up routine tasks, condenses research, drafts emails or proposals, and even helps with homework and résumé writing. Many say it frees up time for other activities, turns tedious work into a few clicks, and serves as a “coach” that improves writing, vocabulary, and idea generation.\n\n**Creative support** is another strong theme. A sizable share (about one‑third) mention that AI has opened new artistic possibilities—generating images, assisting with drawing, or providing quick visual edits—making self‑expression easier for those who previously struggled.\n\n**Learning and information access** also receive high marks. Respondents appreciate instant summaries, quick fact‑checking, and the ability to explore technical subjects without digging through numerous sources, likening AI to an upgraded search engine.\n\n**Convenience in daily life** appears frequently. People note that AI‑driven recommendations, voice‑dictation correction, home‑automation suggestions, and personalized suggestions make everyday decisions smoother.\n\nOn the **neutral or modest side**, a minority view AI as an optional tool that helps with research or idea‑generation but does not fundamentally change their routine. For these users, AI is useful but not indispensable.\n\nThe **negative and cautionary remarks** account for roughly one‑tenth of the comments. Concerns cluster around three areas:\n\n1. **Privacy and data tracking** – many express unease that AI records searches, preferences, and personal details, feeling it intrudes on their privacy.\n2. **Trust and authenticity** – a number of participants report growing suspicion toward content that might be AI‑generated, leading to anxiety about art, writing, and the credibility of information.\n3. **Job and societal impact** – worries surface about potential job displacement, over‑reliance on AI, and the way AI‑driven algorithms may fuel social‑media addiction.\n\nIn sum, the prevailing sentiment is that AI has become an integral, productivity‑boosting companion for most users, enhancing research, creativity, and daily convenience. At the same time, a notable subset voices legitimate concerns about privacy, trust, and broader societal effects, suggesting that while AI is welcomed, its adoption is tempered by caution.",
