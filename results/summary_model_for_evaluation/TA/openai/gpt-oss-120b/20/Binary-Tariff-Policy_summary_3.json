    "main_points": "The discussion reflects a largely skeptical view of the current tariff policy. Roughly half of the comments describe the tariffs as harmful—pointing to higher consumer prices, strained relationships with trading partners (especially China), and adverse effects on small businesses and everyday households. Concerns about inflation, reduced purchasing power and the limited short‑term job creation are common threads in these negative assessments.\n\nAbout a quarter of the participants argue that the tariffs could be beneficial in the longer run. They cite potential gains such as increased federal revenue, a more balanced trade ledger, protection for certain domestic industries, and the prospect of lifting some workers out of poverty. These proponents often frame the policy as a strategic, future‑oriented move that may ultimately strengthen the U.S. economy despite short‑term discomfort.\n\nThe remaining comments adopt a mixed stance, acknowledging that while some sectors might gain and fiscal numbers could improve, the immediate cost burdens on consumers and businesses are likely to outweigh those gains. These viewpoints highlight uncertainty about the net impact, emphasizing that the policy’s success may depend on how it is implemented and how other economic measures evolve alongside it.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans toward negative, with a notable minority seeing possible long‑term advantages, and a smaller group expressing ambivalence about the balance of costs and benefits.",
