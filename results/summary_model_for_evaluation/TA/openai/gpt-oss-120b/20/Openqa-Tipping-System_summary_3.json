    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong consensus that the current tipping system feels over‑mandatory and unfair, especially in the United States. Most participants (around 80 %) say the practice should be optional rather than required, and many (roughly 70 %) argue that the root problem is low base wages – they would prefer workers receive a livable hourly salary so that tips become a genuine “thank‑you” rather than a necessary supplement.\n\nSeveral recurring ideas emerge for how the system could be reshaped:\n\n* **Living‑wage focus** – The majority call for employers to pay a decent wage, removing the reliance on tips to make up a paycheck.  \n* **Eliminate compulsory tip prompts** – Many want the tip‑selection screen removed from receipts and digital orders, allowing customers to tip only when they truly wish to reward good service.  \n* **Fixed or service‑charge alternatives** – A noticeable minority (about 30 %) suggest replacing percentage‑based tips with a flat‑rate amount or a modest, mandatory service charge (e.g., 10 %) that would be included in the bill, leaving any extra gratuity optional.  \n* **Rewarding the tip‑giver** – A smaller group (≈ 15 %) proposes giving customers something tangible for tipping, such as a thank‑you note, a coupon, or a small future discount.  \n* **Cultural comparison** – Some participants point to European models where tipping is rare because wages are higher, using that as a benchmark for improvement.  \n* **Critique of the U.S. norm** – Several comments (around 20 %) describe the American tipping culture as a loophole that lets employers pay below‑minimum wages, calling it “out of control” and urging systemic change.\n\nOverall, the feedback leans heavily toward making tipping a true expression of appreciation rather than a compulsory part of the transaction, with the most widely supported remedy being higher base pay for service‑industry workers.",
