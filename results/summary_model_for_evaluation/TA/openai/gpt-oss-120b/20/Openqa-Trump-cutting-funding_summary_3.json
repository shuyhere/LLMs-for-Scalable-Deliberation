    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong consensus that cutting academic funding would be detrimental. Most respondents stress that education is the foundation of a healthy society and that reduced resources would jeopardize students, research, innovation, and the nation’s long‑term competitiveness. They point to the risk of losing talented researchers, widening inequities for low‑income learners, and weakening the country’s scientific edge.\n\nA smaller share of participants try to rationalize the cuts. Some argue that the reductions are a reaction to perceived left‑leaning politics within universities, while a few express confidence that the administration has legitimate reasons for the policy, even if those reasons are not fully explained.\n\nA minority of commenters either lack sufficient information to form an opinion or adopt a more conspiratorial tone, describing the cuts as a deliberate strategy to keep the populace “dumb” or as characteristic of authoritarian governance.\n\nOverall, the prevailing view is that any substantial reduction in academic funding is short‑sighted and harmful, and that a balanced approach—preserving essential support for education and research while addressing fiscal concerns—would be far more likely to serve the country’s future interests.",
