    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe discussion reveals a strong consensus that the current tipping practice in the United States feels overly compulsory and often disconnected from the quality of service received. Roughly four‑in‑ten participants argue that tipping should no longer be mandatory and that customers should not feel pressured or “bully‑ed” into adding a tip, especially for small or self‑service transactions such as pick‑up orders.\n\nA similarly large share—about one‑third of the comments—emphasizes the need for a livable base wage for service‑industry workers. Many respondents note that tipping has become a substitute for fair wages, and they propose that employers should guarantee a sufficient hourly salary so that tips become a genuine expression of gratitude rather than a financial necessity for employees.\n\nSeveral concrete reforms are suggested:\n\n* **Service‑charge model:** Around ten percent of the comments favor replacing discretionary tips with a compulsory service charge (e.g., a flat 10 % added to every bill) while keeping optional tipping optional.\n* **Fixed‑amount tipping:** A minority propose moving away from percentage‑based tips toward standard fixed amounts (e.g., $20–$30), especially on low‑priced checks, to simplify the process and encourage more generous giving.\n* **Incentives for tippers:** A small portion of the feedback recommends that customers receive a tangible acknowledgment—such as a thank‑you note or a future coupon—when they tip, turning the act into a more rewarding exchange.\n* **Standardized tiers:** Some suggest establishing clear tipping “tiers” linked to purchase size so customers are not unintentionally pressured to give more than they can afford.\n* **European‑style integration:** A few participants point to practices outside the United States, advocating for a system where tips are baked into overall wages or integrated into the payment process, thereby eliminating the separate tip line.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that tipping should be a voluntary gesture tied to service quality, not an implicit requirement that masks inadequate employee compensation. The majority of commenters would like to see the system restructured—either by guaranteeing livable wages, instituting a modest, transparent service charge, or by simplifying tip calculations—so that tipping once again serves its original purpose: a genuine thank‑you for good service.",
