    "main_points": "The respondents overwhelmingly see AI as a practical assistant that makes everyday work and personal tasks faster and easier.  \n- **Productivity and time‑saving** are the most frequently mentioned benefits; roughly three‑quarters of the comments note that AI speeds up routine work, condenses research, drafts documents, and handles repetitive chores, freeing up extra time for other activities.  \n- **Research and information‑gathering** also stand out, with about one‑quarter of participants highlighting AI’s ability to pull together summaries, locate sources quickly, and help them learn new technical material.  \n- **Creative support** appears in a notable share of remarks (around one‑fifth), where users describe AI‑generated art, design ideas, or assistance with visual expression that they previously found difficult.  \n- **Personal convenience** is another recurring theme, with many noting that AI‑driven recommendations, voice‑dictation correction, smart‑home control, and quick fact‑checking simplify daily routines.  \n\nAlongside these positives, a smaller but significant portion of the feedback raises concerns:  \n- **Accuracy and bias** are mentioned in roughly one‑in‑ten comments, stressing the need to verify AI‑produced summaries and the perception that certain sources are favoured.  \n- **Privacy, data use, and job security** surface in about fifteen percent of the remarks, reflecting worries about personal information being harvested and the potential for AI to replace human labour.  \n- **Emotional and trust‑related effects**—such as feeling uneasy about the authenticity of creative work or becoming more skeptical of others’ output—are noted by a minority of participants.  \n\nOverall, the picture is one of strong enthusiasm for AI’s ability to boost efficiency, aid learning, and unlock new creative possibilities, tempered by a cautious awareness of reliability, privacy, and broader societal impacts.",
