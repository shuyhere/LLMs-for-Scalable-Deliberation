    "main_points": "The discussion was dominated by opposition to mandatory real‑name registration on social media, with roughly six‑tenths of the comments rejecting the idea outright. The most frequently cited worries centered on privacy erosion and the potential for personal data to be harvested, sold, or exposed through hacks or government requests. Many participants highlighted the risk of unwanted attention, stalking, or discrimination—especially for people whose political views, employment status, or personal circumstances (such as victims of domestic abuse) could make anonymity essential for safety and freedom of expression.\n\nAround a quarter of the responses took a more nuanced stance, acknowledging possible benefits while stressing limits. Proponents argued that linking posts to real identities could boost accountability, curb cyber‑bullying, cat‑fishing, and harassment, and increase credibility and trust among users. However, even those who saw merit often qualified their support, suggesting that real‑name verification might be appropriate only for platform‑internal purposes or that users should retain the option to adopt pseudonyms for legitimate reasons.\n\nThe remaining comments were clearly supportive (about 15 %). These contributors emphasized that real‑name policies could deter abusive behavior, improve the overall tone of online discourse, and make it harder for malicious actors to hide behind anonymity.\n\nAcross the spectrum, a recurring theme was the distinction between requirements imposed by the platforms themselves versus those mandated by governments. Several participants expressed willingness to consider platform‑driven verification but resisted governmental enforcement, fearing broader surveillance and suppression of dissenting viewpoints.\n\nIn summary, while a minority view sees real‑name registration as a tool for greater civility and trust, the prevailing sentiment stresses that the privacy, safety, and expressive freedoms afforded by anonymity outweigh the potential gains in accountability. Any policy move toward mandatory real‑name use would need to address these privacy‑related concerns, provide robust data protections, and preserve options for pseudonymous participation.",
