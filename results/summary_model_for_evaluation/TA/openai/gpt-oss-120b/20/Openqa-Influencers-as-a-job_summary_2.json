    "main_points": "The remarks paint a nuanced picture of internet influencers as a growing, sometimes contentious, segment of the digital economy.\n\n**Positive and supportive views**  \n- Roughly half of the comments celebrate influencers as legitimate professionals who open new career pathways, generate substantial income, and provide entertaining or informative content that many people rely on for ideas, advice, and even news.  \n- Many respondents appreciate the accessibility of this work—being able to create and share from anywhere—and see it as a natural evolution of media, comparable to earlier forms of celebrity or entertainment.  \n- A portion also highlights the entrepreneurial spirit involved, noting that influencers can turn personal passions into viable businesses and that the field has expanded especially since the pandemic.\n\n**Reservations and criticisms**  \n- About 40 % of the comments express concerns. Common threads include worries about authenticity and the prevalence of “fake” or overly scripted personas, the saturation of the market, and the pressure on creators to chase trends rather than innovate.  \n- Some observers liken the phenomenon to a modern “Tower of Babel,” suggesting that the endless proliferation of personal brands can fragment communication and promote superficial notions of success.  \n- A few participants note potential negative social effects, such as encouraging unrealistic expectations of wealth, contributing to internet addiction, or prompting creators to adopt sensationalist tactics to capture attention.\n\n**Calls for responsibility**  \n- Across the spectrum, there is a consensus that influencers wield significant influence over their audiences and therefore bear a responsibility to act ethically, be transparent, and consider the impact of their recommendations on followers.\n\n**Overall impression**  \nThe collective sentiment acknowledges influencers as a legitimate and influential part of contemporary culture, while simultaneously warning that the field is becoming crowded, sometimes superficial, and in need of greater authenticity and accountability. The balance of enthusiasm and caution reflects a broader societal negotiation over how new digital professions fit into the larger media and economic landscape.",
