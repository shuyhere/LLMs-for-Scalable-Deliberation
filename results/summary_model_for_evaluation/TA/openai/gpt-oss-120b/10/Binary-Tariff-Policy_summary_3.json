    "main_points": "The discussion reflects a clear split in how respondents view the current U.S. tariff policy. Around three‑fifths of the comments describe the tariffs as harmful, while roughly two‑fifths see them as beneficial.\n\n**Key concerns among the critics (≈60 %):**  \n- **Higher consumer prices** and inflation are repeatedly mentioned as immediate, tangible effects.  \n- **Small‑business strain** and broader economic slowdown are highlighted, with worries that the added costs outweigh any gains.  \n- **Trade relations**—especially with China—are portrayed as deteriorating, potentially limiting future market access.  \n- **Equity issues** surface, with some participants arguing the policy primarily advantages the government or wealthy interests rather than ordinary Americans.\n\n**Main arguments from supporters (≈40 %):**  \n- **Fiscal relief**: Several respondents note that tariffs generate revenue that can help reduce national debt and stabilize the budget.  \n- **Economic revitalization**: A few see the measures as a way to lift the United States out of chronic trade imbalances, ultimately raising living standards and reducing poverty.  \n- **Stability and predictability**: Some point to be reassured that price levels have not yet surged and that the policy could become a steady source of fiscal strength over time.  \n- **Leadership confidence**: A subset ties the policy’s perceived benefits to confidence in the current administration’s business‑oriented approach.\n\nOverall, the conversation underscores a tension between short‑term consumer pain and long‑term fiscal optimism. Critics focus on immediate cost increases and strained trade ties, whereas proponents emphasize revenue gains and the prospect of a more self‑sufficient economy. The balance of sentiment suggests that while the policy enjoys a notable base of support, a majority of participants remain skeptical of its net impact on everyday Americans.",
