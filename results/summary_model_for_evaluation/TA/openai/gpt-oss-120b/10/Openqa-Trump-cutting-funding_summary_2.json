    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view cuts to academic funding as detrimental. Most respondents argue that education is the foundation for the nation’s future, warning that reduced resources will hurt students, limit research, stifle innovation, and weaken long‑term competitiveness. Several remarks stress the unfairness to both children and adults who rely on affordable higher‑education opportunities, and note that diminished funding could drive researchers abroad, benefitting rival countries. A minority of participants hint at a political rationale for cuts—citing concerns about perceived left‑leaning influences in academia—but even these voices acknowledge that such reductions risk freezing independent thought. One comment simply requests more detail before forming an opinion. Overall, roughly eight‑tenths of the feedback expresses strong opposition to the funding cuts, emphasizing the need for sustained investment in education to safeguard societal and economic health.",
