    "main_points": "The comments reveal a split view on the current U.S. tariff policy. Roughly six‑tenths of the respondents see the tariffs as harmful, emphasizing rising consumer prices, inflation, added costs for everyday living, and adverse effects on small businesses and U.S.–China relations. Many also note a perceived lack of job creation and question whether the policy truly benefits most Americans.\n\nAround four‑tenths of the participants take a more optimistic stance. They point to the potential for increased government revenue, a reduction in the fiscal burden from low‑tariff imports, and the prospect of long‑term economic stabilization. Some argue that the tariffs could help lift, rather than depress, the standard of living for U.S. households and may eventually strengthen the budget without immediate price spikes.\n\nOverall, the discussion balances concerns about short‑term economic strain and consumer hardship against hopes that higher tariffs will improve fiscal health and foster future growth. The dominant sentiment leans toward caution about the negative impacts, while a notable minority remains hopeful about longer‑term benefits.",
