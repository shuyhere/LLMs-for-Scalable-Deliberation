    "main_points": "The comments coalesce around a **strong opposition** to reductions in academic funding. Most respondents argue that education is a foundational pillar for both individual opportunity and national prosperity. They stress that cutting resources jeopardizes students—especially those who cannot afford tuition—undermines research and innovation, and threatens long‑term economic and health outcomes (e.g., medical breakthroughs). Several remarks specifically link diminished funding to a loss of global competitiveness, warning that talented researchers may migrate to rival nations.\n\nA smaller portion acknowledges a possible political motive behind the cuts, suggesting that concerns about perceived left‑leaning bias in academia could justify fiscal restraint, yet still warns that such reductions risk stifling independent thought. One participant admits a lack of information and refrains from forming an opinion.\n\nOverall, **the overwhelming majority of the feedback (around eight‑plus out of ten comments)** emphasizes that reducing academic funding is short‑sighted, unfair to learners of all ages, and harmful to the country’s future innovation and competitiveness, while only a minority expresses neutrality or conditional justification.",
