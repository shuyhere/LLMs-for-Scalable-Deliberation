    "main_points": "The discussion reveals a strong consensus that the current tipping model places undue pressure on customers and creates financial instability for workers. Roughly one‑third of the comments call for eliminating mandatory or “forced” tipping altogether, arguing that tips should be optional and never imposed through pop‑ups or preset percentages. A similar proportion stresses the need for a guaranteed, livable base wage so that employees are not dependent on tips to make ends meet.  \n\nMany participants (about 20 %) emphasize that tipping should reflect the quality of service rather than be a routine surcharge on every transaction, warning that the practice has become an “overkill” for small purchases. A smaller share (around 10 % each) proposes concrete improvements: one idea is to give customers a tangible acknowledgment—such as a thank‑you note or a coupon—when they tip, while another suggests moving from percentage‑based calculations to fixed‑amount standards (e.g., a $20–$30 tip) to simplify the process and encourage more generous contributions.  \n\nOverall, the comments converge on three core themes: (1) make tipping truly optional and free from coercive, (2) ensure employees receive a stable, livable wage independent of tips, and (3) align tips with actual service quality, possibly by redesigning the system to use fixed amounts or by providing reciprocal gestures to the customer.",
