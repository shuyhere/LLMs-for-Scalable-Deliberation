    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong consensus that tipping should not be compulsory. Most respondents argue that the current system pressures customers and that businesses should instead guarantee workers a livable base wage. Around two‑thirds of the remarks call for eliminating mandatory or “default” tip prompts, while a smaller share (roughly one‑quarter) suggest that tips remain optional and tied directly to the quality of service.\n\nSeveral ideas are offered for reshaping how tips are expressed when they are given. One theme proposes rewarding tippers with a tangible acknowledgement—such as a handwritten thank‑you note or a coupon for a future visit—so that the act feels reciprocal rather than a forced transaction. Another suggestion is to replace percentage‑based calculations with fixed‑amount standards (e.g., a $20–$30 tip for a typical meal), which many feel would simplify the process and encourage more generous giving.\n\nOverall, the feedback points toward three guiding principles for any revised tipping model: (1) make tipping truly voluntary and free from mandatory prompts; (2) ensure employees receive a baseline, livable wage independent of tips; and (3) if tips are offered, provide clear, service‑linked incentives or simple fixed amounts that acknowledge both the customer’s appreciation and the worker’s contribution.",
