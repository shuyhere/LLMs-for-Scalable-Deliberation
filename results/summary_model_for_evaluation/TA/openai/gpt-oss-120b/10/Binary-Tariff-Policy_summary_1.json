    "main_points": "The comments reveal a clear split in how the tariff policy is being perceived. Roughly six‑tenths of the respondents view the tariffs as harmful, while about four‑tenths see them as beneficial.\n\n**Negative perceptions** focus on several recurring concerns:  \n- **Higher consumer costs** and inflation, with many noting price spikes for everyday goods.  \n- **Adverse effects on small businesses** and overall economic health.  \n- **Strained international relations**, especially with China, and the perception that the policy yields limited new jobs.  \n- **Skepticism about who benefits**, with some describing the tariffs as serving political leaders or the wealthy rather than ordinary Americans.\n\n**Positive perceptions** highlight different expectations and observations:  \n- **Revenue generation** that could help stabilize the federal budget and reduce debt.  \n- **Absence of noticeable price increases** in some cases, suggesting limited immediate consumer impact.  \n- **Long‑term economic benefits**, including the idea that the tariffs could lift households out of poverty and support broader economic growth.  \n- **Confidence in leadership**, with a few commenters expressing trust that the policy will ultimately favor the U.S. economy.\n\nOverall, while the majority of participants are concerned that the tariffs are driving up costs and hurting both consumers and businesses, a substantial minority believe the measures will strengthen fiscal health and promote future prosperity. The debate centers on short‑term price pressures versus anticipated longer‑term fiscal and economic gains.",
