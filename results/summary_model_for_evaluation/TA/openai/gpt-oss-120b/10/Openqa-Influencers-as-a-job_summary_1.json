    "main_points": "The comments collectively portray internet influencers as a legitimate and increasingly prominent career path. Most respondents highlight the **positive impact** influencers have—providing entertainment, niche information, product recommendations, and even alternative news sources. They note that many creators are able to turn a personal passion into a **substantial income**, enjoy the flexibility of working online, and play a key role in shaping trends and connecting with audiences in ways traditional media often cannot.\n\nA sizable portion also **recognizes the broader cultural shift** that has made influencer work feel comparable to earlier forms of celebrity, emphasizing the more “down‑to‑earth” and personal nature of modern online personalities. Several comments stress the importance of **authenticity and responsibility**, suggesting that the space works best when creators who are genuine and transparent are supported.\n\nThere are **some reservations**. A minority of respondents find influencers **annoying or inauthentic**, and one comment points to a downside of trend‑driven homogeneity—where constant pressure to follow the latest fashions can stifle creativity and individuality.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans heavily toward **support and appreciation** (about three‑quarters of the feedback), with a smaller share acknowledging **neutral understanding** of the phenomenon and a modest fraction expressing **critical concerns** about authenticity and creative stagnation.",
