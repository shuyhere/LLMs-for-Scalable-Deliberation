    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Strong Preference for Voluntary, Service‑Based Tipping**  \n  A large majority of respondents (well over 70 %) say that tips should be given only when the customer feels the service truly merits it. Many argue that the tip should be a genuine thank‑you rather than a compulsory add‑on, and several suggest that tipping should be limited to sit‑down restaurants or other settings where staff provide direct, attentive service.\n\n- **Criticism of Mandatory or “Built‑In” Tips**  \n  A sizable share of comments (around 60 %) criticize the current practice of pre‑selected tip percentages on point‑of‑sale screens, especially for low‑touch transactions such as coffee‑to‑go, pizza pickup, or fast‑food orders. Respondents repeatedly call for an obvious “0 %” or “no tip” button and for the tip prompt to appear only after service has been rendered.\n\n- **Calls for Better Base Compensation**  \n  The most common theme (about 80 % of the feedback) is that tipping is being used to make up for wages that are far below a livable level. Many propose replacing the tip‑reliant model with a guaranteed minimum or living wage, often paired with a modest, automatically‑included service charge (e.g., a flat 10 % fee) so that tips become a true bonus rather than a necessity.\n\n- **Alternative Structures and Incentives**  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Tips:** Some suggest moving away from percentage‑based suggestions to set amounts (e.g., $20‑$30 for a full‑service meal).  \n  - **Reward‑Based Ideas:** A few participants propose giving customers something tangible for tipping—such as thank‑you notes, coupons, or a small token—so that the act feels reciprocal.  \n  - **European‑Style Model:** Several respondents point to the practice in many European countries where wages are sufficient and tips are optional or already baked into the price.\n\n- **Support for Tipping When Service Excels**  \n  While many want to curb the pressure to tip, a notable minority (roughly 30 %) still view tipping as an important way to reward exceptional service and to help workers who rely on it. These commenters tend to tip generously in restaurants and for delivery or personal‑care services, but they also stress that the practice should remain optional and not be forced in low‑service contexts.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment**  \n  The consensus leans toward **reforming** the system rather than abolishing it outright. The preferred reforms include:  \n  1. **Making tips truly optional** and removing default suggestions on payment terminals.  \n  2. **Ensuring employees receive a livable wage** so that tips become a bonus rather than a wage supplement.  \n  3. **Restricting tip prompts to situations involving substantial, direct service** (e.g., sit‑down dining, delivery, personal care).  \n  4. **Providing clearer, less intrusive UI options** (prominent “no tip” button, no pre‑selected percentages).  \n\nThese changes aim to preserve the goodwill‑based aspect of tipping for high‑quality service while eliminating the feeling of coercion and the reliance on tips to compensate for inadequate base pay.",
