    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nThe overwhelming share of participants view the Trump‑era tariff policy as detrimental to the U.S. economy and society. Most commenters stress that tariffs act as a tax on imported goods, which is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday items such as groceries, fuel, electronics, and household products. This price pressure is seen as eroding purchasing power, especially for middle‑ and lower‑income households, and is linked to reduced consumer spending, slower economic growth, and a heightened risk of recession.\n\nA large portion of the feedback highlights the strain on small businesses and niche producers that rely on imported inputs. Respondents in logistics, retail, and creative‑goods sectors describe lower order volumes, delayed shipments, and tighter margins, often attributing these challenges directly to the tariff hikes. Several comments also point to broader strategic costs: deteriorating relationships with key trading partners, the threat of retaliatory tariffs, and a loss of U.S. “soft power” in global trade negotiations.\n\nWhile the dominant sentiment is negative, a minority of participants argue that tariffs could yield long‑term benefits. These views emphasize potential gains such as:\n\n- **Revenue generation** – tariffs are expected to add billions of dollars to the federal budget, which some believe can be redirected to domestic priorities.\n- **Domestic‑industry protection** – certain sectors (e.g., steel, aluminum) might experience short‑term job preservation or modest growth.\n- **Strategic leverage** – proponents suggest tariffs can force foreign governments to negotiate fairer trade terms and reduce perceived exploitation of the U.S. market.\n\nEven among those who see possible upside, many acknowledge that the short‑run pain—higher consumer costs, supply‑chain disruptions, and uncertainty for businesses—is significant. A recurring theme is the belief that any positive effects would likely materialize only after a substantial adjustment period, during which the economy endures price inflation and reduced competitiveness.\n\n**Key take‑aways**\n\n- **≈ 80 %** of the comments describe the tariffs as harmful, citing higher consumer prices, inflation, reduced spending, and adverse impacts on small businesses and trade relations.\n- **≈ 15 %** present a mixed view, recognizing short‑term drawbacks but foreseeing potential long‑term advantages such as increased government revenue or strategic bargaining power.\n- **≈ 5 %** are primarily optimistic, focusing on job creation, domestic manufacturing revival, and the perception that the policy corrects historic trade imbalances.\n\nOverall, the consensus leans strongly toward the view that the current tariff regime imposes immediate economic costs on consumers and businesses, while any prospective benefits remain uncertain and contingent on future policy adjustments and broader structural changes in U.S. manufacturing capacity.",
