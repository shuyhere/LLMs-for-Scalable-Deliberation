    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Strong Preference for Making Tipping Optional** – A clear majority of participants (around 70 %) want customers to decide whether to tip and how much, arguing that the current system feels coercive, especially when tip prompts appear on electronic payment screens or for low‑service transactions (e.g., coffee to‑go, self‑service counters).\n\n- **Calls for a Living Wage Instead of Reliance on Tips** – Roughly two‑thirds of respondents (≈ 65 %) say the root problem is that many service workers are paid far below a livable wage. They propose that employers should pay a fair hourly wage, making tips a genuine bonus rather than a necessity.\n\n- **Support for a Fixed Service Charge or “No‑Tip” Model** – About one‑third (≈ 30 %) suggest replacing discretionary tips with a modest, transparent service charge (often 10 % or a flat amount) that is included in the bill, similar to practices in some other countries. A smaller group (≈ 15 %) favors eliminating tips altogether and moving to a fully wage‑based model.\n\n- **Desire for Less Intrusive Point‑of‑Sale (POS) Interfaces** – Nearly half of the comments (≈ 45 %) criticize the way modern POS systems automatically suggest tip percentages or make the “no tip” option hard to find. Respondents want a clearly visible $0 option or the removal of tip prompts unless a clear service is rendered.\n\n- **Tip Amount Should Reflect Service Quality** – Around 55 % of participants stress that tips should be tied to the quality of service. Many say they tip generously for excellent service but reduce or skip tips for poor or minimal service, and they dislike any expectation of a fixed percentage for all transactions.\n\n- **Fixed‑Amount or Tiered Suggestions Preferred Over Percentages** – Some commenters (≈ 20 %) propose moving away from percentage‑based suggestions toward fixed dollar amounts (e.g., $5, $10) or tiered options that are easier to understand and less likely to pressure low‑budget customers.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons and Calls for Change** – A notable portion (≈ 25 %) reference practices in Europe or other regions where tipping is minimal or baked into prices, using these examples to argue that the U.S. system is uniquely burdensome.\n\n- **Mixed but Generally Positive Attitudes Toward Tipping When Service Is Good** – While many criticize the system, a substantial minority (≈ 40 %) still view tipping as a valuable way to reward good service and help low‑wage workers, provided it remains voluntary and not mandatory.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment** – The dominant sentiment is that the current tipping framework is over‑extended, often feels compulsory, and shifts the responsibility for fair compensation from employers to customers. Most participants favor reforms that make tipping truly optional, simplify or remove tip prompts, and ensure workers receive a stable, livable wage, with tips serving only as a bonus for exceptional service.",
