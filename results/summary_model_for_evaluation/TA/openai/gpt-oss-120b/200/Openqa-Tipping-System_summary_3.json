    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Sentiment** – The majority of respondents view the current tipping system as problematic. Roughly three‑quarters of the comments call for a major change, while about one‑quarter are either satisfied with the status quo or only want minor tweaks.\n\n- **Key Criticisms**\n  * **Mandatory or “forced” tipping** – Many participants complain that tips are now asked for on almost every purchase (even for self‑service items such as coffee, pizza take‑out, or bottled water). They argue that the default pre‑selected percentages on electronic POS screens make it feel compulsory and uncomfortable to decline.\n  * **Low base wages** – A recurring theme is that tipping masks inadequate employer wages. Commenters repeatedly note that servers, bartenders, delivery drivers, and other frontline staff are often paid far below a livable minimum wage, forcing customers to subsidize payroll.\n  * **Inconsistent application** – People are frustrated that tips are requested in situations where little or no service is rendered (e.g., grab‑and‑go orders, fast‑food counters, self‑checkout). This blurs the line between tipping for “good service” and tipping as a de‑facto tax.\n  * **Psychological pressure** – Several remarks highlight the stress placed on diners who feel obligated to tip a certain percentage, even when service is mediocre or when their budget is tight.\n\n- **Proposed Alternatives**\n  * **Eliminate or make tipping optional** – A large portion of the feedback suggests removing the tip prompt entirely, allowing a $0 option to be clearly visible, or limiting tip requests to full‑service restaurants and genuine service interactions.\n  * **Flat service charge or built‑in gratuity** – Some suggest replacing variable tips with a modest, fixed service fee (often cited around 10 % or a set dollar amount) that is automatically added to the bill, similar to practices in Japan or parts of Europe.\n  * **Higher base wages** – The most common remedy is to require employers to pay a livable minimum wage (often referenced as $15 /hour or at least the federal minimum). When workers receive a fair wage, tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity.\n  * **Reward‑based tipping** – A minority of commenters favor keeping tipping but tying it strictly to service quality—e.g., offering written thank‑you notes, coupons, or allowing customers to choose a fixed amount (such as $20‑$30) instead of percentage‑based suggestions.\n  * **Transparency and control** – Suggestions include redesigning POS interfaces so the “no tip” button is front‑and‑center, removing default percentages, and providing clear information that tips are voluntary.\n\n- **Support for Tipping**\n  * About a third of the participants still view tipping positively when it reflects appreciation for **exceptional** service. They describe themselves as generous tippers, see tips as a vital supplement for low‑paid workers, and argue that tipping can motivate higher service standards.\n  * Some propose a hybrid model: maintain tipping for sit‑down restaurant service while eliminating it for counter‑service or self‑service transactions.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons**\n  * Several comments point to European or Asian models where tips are either included in menu prices or not expected because employees receive a solid wage. These examples are used to argue that the U.S. system could be reformed without eliminating gratitude altogether.\n\n- **Overall Recommendation (as inferred from the consensus)**\n  * Move **away from mandatory, percentage‑based tipping** toward a system where:\n    1. **Tips are optional** and presented as a genuine gratuity rather than a required surcharge.\n    2. **Employers provide a livable base wage**, removing the reliance on customer tips to meet basic income needs.\n    3. **When tips are offered**, they should be tied to the quality of service and possibly delivered as a fixed amount or a modest service charge that is transparent to the customer.\n\nThis synthesis reflects the dominant concerns (forced tipping, low wages, inconsistency) and the most frequently suggested reforms (optional tipping, higher wages, flat service fees), while acknowledging the minority view that supports traditional tipping for rewarding good service.",
