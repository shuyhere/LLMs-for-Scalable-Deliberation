    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall sentiment:** The great majority of participants view the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society.  \n- **Key concerns:**  \n  * **Higher consumer prices** – most respondents note that tariffs are being passed on to shoppers, driving up the cost of everyday goods, groceries, fuel and imports.  \n  * **Impact on small businesses** – many point out that small firms that rely on imported components are seeing tighter margins or are forced to raise prices, with some fearing closures.  \n  * **Trade‑relationship strain** – a sizable share mention deteriorating diplomatic and commercial ties with key partners (especially China), the risk of retaliatory tariffs, and a loss of U.S. “soft power.”  \n  * **Uncertainty for investment** – the unpredictable nature of the tariffs is described as discouraging domestic and foreign investment and slowing long‑term growth.  \n\n- **Perceived short‑term vs. long‑term effects:**  \n  * **Short‑run:** Over 70 % of comments stress immediate negative outcomes—price inflation, reduced consumer spending, and pressure on employment.  \n  * **Long‑run:** Roughly 15 % of participants acknowledge possible future benefits, such as modest revenue gains for the Treasury, a modest boost to certain protected industries (e.g., steel/aluminum), or the eventual return of some manufacturing jobs. These hopeful views are usually qualified with “if the policy is sustained” or “once supply chains adjust.”  \n\n- **Positive notes (a minority view):** About 10 % of the remarks highlight potential upside, citing:  \n  * Increased tariff revenue that could help reduce the federal deficit.  \n  * The notion that protecting domestic producers might eventually lead to more U.S. jobs and greater strategic independence.  \n\n- **Mixed or nuanced positions:** A small portion of the discussion (around 5 %) acknowledges both costs and benefits, recognizing that while some sectors may gain, the broader economy bears the burden of higher prices and reduced purchasing power.\n\n**Takeaway:** The consensus leans heavily toward a negative assessment of the current tariff policy, primarily because of rising consumer costs, strain on small businesses, and weakened trade relationships. Only a modest share of participants see possible long‑term gains, and even those are tempered by concerns about implementation and the time required for any benefits to materialize.",
