    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Consensus for Reform**  \n  A large majority of commenters (well over half) feel that the current tipping system is flawed and should be re‑engineered. The most common suggestions are to **remove mandatory or “default” tip prompts** and to **ensure that workers receive a livable wage** so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity.  \n\n- **Key Problems Identified**  \n  1. **Mandatory or intrusive tip screens** – many find the automatic tip suggestions on tablets or apps uncomfortable, especially when no service has been rendered (e.g., pick‑up orders, coffee counters).  \n  2. **Unequal pay structures** – the reliance on tips allows employers to pay wages far below a living wage (often the legal minimum or even lower).  \n  3. **Over‑extension of tipping culture** – respondents note that tips are now expected for virtually every transaction, from fast‑food purchases to self‑service items, which feels coercive.  \n  4. **Unpredictable earnings for workers** – because tips fluctuate, employees cannot count on a stable income.  \n\n- **Suggested Improvements**  \n  - **Shift to a fixed service charge** (e.g., a flat 10 % or a set dollar amount) that is automatically included in the bill, making tipping optional thereafter.  \n  - **Make tip prompts truly optional** with a clearly visible “$0” or “No tip” choice, especially for non‑service transactions.  \n  - **Offer tangible thank‑you gestures** (e.g., a thank‑you note or coupon) when a tip is given, to reinforce that tipping is a reward for good service.  \n  - **Adopt a European‑style model** where employers pay a fair base wage and tipping is limited to situations where service exceeds expectations.  \n  - **Replace percentage‑based suggestions with fixed amounts** for low‑ticket items, or provide clearer guidance that ties the tip to service quality rather than bill size.  \n\n- **Perspectives Supporting Tipping**  \n  A smaller but still notable share of commenters (roughly one‑quarter) view tipping as a **positive way to reward excellent service** and are comfortable with the practice when it is truly optional and tied to service quality. These participants often emphasize that they already tip generously in sit‑down restaurants and that tips can supplement wages when those wages are already adequate.  \n\n- **Hybrid Views**  \n  Some participants propose a **dual approach**: maintain tipping for high‑touch service (e.g., table service, delivery, haircuts) while eliminating tip prompts for low‑touch or self‑service transactions. Others suggest that **tips should be optional but accompanied by a mandatory base wage**, effectively turning tips into a bonus rather than a wage substitute.  \n\n- **Overall Tone**  \n  The sentiment is strongly tilted toward **making tipping voluntary** and **addressing the underlying wage issue**. While a minority defend the status quo or suggest modest tweaks (e.g., better tip‑screen design), the dominant narrative calls for systemic change—either by instituting a universal service charge, guaranteeing livable wages, or both.",
