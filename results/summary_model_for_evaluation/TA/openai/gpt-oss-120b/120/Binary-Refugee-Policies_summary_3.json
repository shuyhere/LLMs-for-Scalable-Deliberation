    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe great majority of respondents are in favour of the United States accepting more refugees who are fleeing war or persecution. Around 70 % express support, although many attach conditions such as thorough vetting, caps on numbers, or guarantees that the policy will not strain public services. The remaining ≈30 % are opposed, citing concerns about economic pressures, security risks, and an already‑overburdened immigration system.\n\n### Main Reasons for Supporting Acceptance\n- **Humanitarian compassion** – roughly half of the supporters emphasise the moral imperative to provide safety to people escaping violence or persecution.  \n- **Alignment with American values** – about a third invoke the nation’s historic identity as a refuge for the oppressed and the principle of liberty.  \n- **Economic and societal benefits** – a smaller share points to potential gains such as revitalising rural areas, creating jobs, and enhancing cultural diversity.  \n- **Strategic responsibility** – a minority argue that, given U.S. involvement in many conflicts, the country has a duty to help those displaced by its own foreign policies.\n\n### Conditions Frequently Mentioned by Supporters\n- **Rigorous vetting and security checks** – over half of the conditional supporters stress the need to screen refugees for criminal backgrounds or security threats.  \n- **Resource limits and caps** – about a third say the number of admissions should be limited to avoid overwhelming schools, health‑care, and social‑service systems.  \n- **Integration measures** – a smaller segment calls for language training, cultural orientation, and sponsorship programs to aid successful settlement.\n\n### Main Reasons for Opposing Acceptance\n- **Economic strain** – the most common objection (≈40 % of opponents) concerns the cost to taxpayers and the impact on already‑stretched public resources.  \n- **Security and crime worries** – roughly a third fear that insufficient screening could allow dangerous individuals to enter.  \n- **Immigration system overload** – about one‑fifth argue that the current system is already chaotic and cannot absorb additional refugees.  \n- **Cultural and social cohesion** – a smaller share express concerns that large inflows could affect community cohesion or dilute national identity.\n\n### Overall Tone\nThe discourse is heavily weighted toward empathy and a sense of moral duty, tempered by pragmatic worries about capacity, security, and fiscal impact. While most participants are inclined to welcome refugees, they overwhelmingly agree that any expansion of the program must be carefully managed through robust vetting, clear limits, and adequate support structures to protect both newcomers and existing citizens.",
