    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe vast majority of the respondents see the Trump‑era tariff policy as harming the U.S. economy and society. Key concerns include:\n\n* **Higher consumer prices and inflation** – most commenters note that tariffs are being passed on to shoppers, driving up the cost of everyday goods and squeezing household budgets.  \n* **Negative effects on small businesses and employment** – many observe that firms that rely on imported inputs face higher costs, reduced margins, and, in some cases, closures or layoffs.  \n* **Strained international relations** – a sizable share mention retaliation from trading partners, deteriorating diplomatic ties, and a loss of U.S. soft‑power.  \n* **Uncertainty and reduced investment** – several participants point out that unpredictable tariff moves discourage corporate investment and could slow long‑term growth.\n\nA smaller but notable portion of the comments highlight potential upsides:\n\n* **Domestic industry protection and job creation** – some argue that tariffs could encourage reshoring of production and protect certain U.S. sectors.  \n* **Fiscal benefits** – a few note the revenue generated for the federal budget and the possibility of narrowing the trade deficit over time.  \n* **Long‑run strategic gains** – a minority suggest that short‑term pain might be offset by future gains in self‑sufficiency and bargaining power.\n\n**Balance of Views**\n\n- Roughly four‑fifths of the feedback is negative, emphasizing price hikes, consumer burden, and trade‑partner backlash.  \n- About one‑fifth expresses optimism, focusing on protection of domestic jobs, revenue gains, and possible long‑term strategic benefits.\n\nOverall, while there is limited optimism about specific advantages, the consensus points to tariffs currently delivering more economic cost than benefit for the broader U.S. population and businesses.",
