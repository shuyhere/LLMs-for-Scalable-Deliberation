    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Strong opposition to mandatory or “default” tipping — about three‑quarters of respondents** want the practice removed or limited.  The most common complaints are that tipping has become an obligatory part of every transaction (including self‑service, take‑out, coffee, and even digital checkout screens), that it pressures customers, and that it masks employers’ failure to pay a livable wage.\n\n- **A large share (≈ 65 %) argue that workers should receive a base wage that meets or exceeds a living minimum** so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessary component of income.  Many cite the sub‑minimum $2.13 tip credit for restaurant staff and call for a federal‑minimum‑wage level (often around $15 / hour) as a baseline.\n\n- **Suggestions for redesigning the system** fall into several clusters:  \n  * **Eliminate the tip prompt altogether** or make a $0 option prominent on point‑of‑sale devices.  \n  * **Replace tips with a modest, mandatory service charge** (commonly 10 %–15 %) that is baked into the bill and distributed to staff, similar to practices in many European countries.  \n  * **Make tipping truly optional and tied to service quality**, with some participants proposing fixed‑amount suggestions (e.g., a $20‑$30 flat tip) or “thank‑you” notes/coupons as incentives.  \n  * **Limit tipping to situations where a distinct service is provided** (full‑service restaurants, delivery, hair‑care, etc.) and avoid it for counter‑service, self‑service, or grab‑and‑go orders.\n\n- **Support for tipping as a voluntary reward** remains in a minority but notable segment (around 20 %).  These respondents view tipping as a way to recognize excellent service, appreciate hard work, or encourage higher standards.  They generally favor keeping the choice in the customer’s hands while still urging fair wages for staff.\n\n- **Critiques of the current technology** appear in roughly one‑third of the comments.  Users find tablet or app‑based tip sliders intrusive, especially when the default is a non‑zero percentage, and they call for clearer “no tip” options or removal of the prompt until after service is rendered.\n\n- **Cultural comparisons** are frequently invoked.  Many point to European or Asian models where service charges replace tipping, arguing that such systems reduce the “tip‑driven” wage structure and simplify the customer experience.\n\n- **Overall sentiment**:**\n  * **≈ 70 %** want the tipping system overhauled or abolished in favor of guaranteed wages.  \n  * **≈ 20 %** support keeping tipping but only as an optional, service‑based reward.  \n  * **≈ 10 %** propose hybrid approaches (service charge plus optional tip, fixed‑amount suggestions, or token rewards).\n\nThe consensus is clear: most people see tipping as a symptom of underpayment rather than a fair compensation model, and they favor reforms that shift the responsibility for wages back to employers while preserving the ability to reward truly exceptional service.",
