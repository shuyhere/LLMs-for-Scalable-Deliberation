    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of respondents view the current tariff policy as detrimental to the United States economy and society. Key concerns repeatedly mentioned include:\n\n- **Higher consumer prices and inflation** – many note that tariffs are passed on to shoppers, reducing purchasing power and making everyday goods less affordable.  \n- **Strain on small businesses and manufacturers** – respondents point out that higher import costs raise operating expenses, threaten profitability, and can force some firms to close or cut jobs.  \n- **Deteriorating trade relationships** – several comments highlight retaliation from other countries, the erosion of the U.S. reputation as a reliable trade partner, and the risk of a broader trade war.  \n- **Reduced economic efficiency and growth** – the policy is seen as an “extra tax” that hampers competition, discourages investment, and could slow overall economic expansion.\n\nA smaller but notable portion of participants argue that tariffs could have **positive or mixed effects** in the longer run:\n\n- **Potential revenue gains** – a few note that tariff collections add billions to the federal budget, which could help reduce deficits.  \n- **Domestic‑industry protection** – some believe that shielding certain sectors might preserve or create U.S. jobs and encourage reshoring of production.  \n- **Strategic leverage** – a handful suggest that tariffs could be used to pressure trade partners into more favorable agreements.\n\nOverall, roughly **four‑fifths** of the comments emphasize negative outcomes, while **about one‑tenth** stress possible benefits, and the remaining **few percent** describe a mixed or uncertain impact. The consensus leans strongly toward the view that, at present, the tariff policy is harming consumers, small businesses, and the broader economic environment, even though a minority anticipate longer‑term gains for specific industries or fiscal balances.",
