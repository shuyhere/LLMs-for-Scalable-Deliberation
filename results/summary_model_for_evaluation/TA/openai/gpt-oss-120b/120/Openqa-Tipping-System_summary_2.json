    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Strong Preference for Removing Mandatory Tipping**  \n  A clear majority of participants (around 70 %) feel that tipping should no longer be compulsory. They argue that the practice is often forced through point‑of‑sale screens, suggested tip percentages, or “mandatory” tip prompts, and that this pressure makes the experience uncomfortable for customers.\n\n- **Call for Living‑Wage Compensation**  \n  Roughly two‑thirds of the respondents (≈ 65 %) say the root problem is low base pay for service workers. They propose that employers should pay a livable wage—often citing a $15‑per‑hour benchmark or at least the federal minimum—so that tips become a genuine bonus rather than a necessity for workers’ survival.\n\n- **Support for Voluntary, Service‑Based Tips**  \n  About one‑third of the comments (≈ 30 %) endorse tipping when it reflects good or exceptional service. These participants suggest that tips should be optional, tied to the quality of the interaction, and not demanded for minimal or self‑service transactions (e.g., coffee pickup, fast‑food orders).\n\n- **Suggestions for Structural Changes**  \n  - **Flat Service Charge:** Nearly 15 % recommend replacing discretionary tips with a modest, uniform service charge (e.g., 10 % or a fixed dollar amount) that is automatically added to the bill.  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Tips:** Around 10 % propose moving away from percentage‑based calculations toward preset tip amounts (e.g., $20‑$30) for certain purchase levels.  \n  - **Improved POS Design:** A similar share (~ 10 %) call for point‑of‑sale systems to make a “no tip” option obvious and to only display tip prompts after service has been rendered.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons and Alternatives**  \n  Several comments (≈ 12 %) reference European or other international models where tipping is rare or nonexistent, arguing that those systems work because workers receive adequate wages directly from employers.\n\n- **Mixed Feelings About the Current System**  \n  While many are frustrated, a small but notable minority (≈ 8 %) are comfortable with the status quo, stating that tipping encourages better service and that they personally tip generously. Even among these, there is often an acknowledgment that higher wages would reduce the reliance on tips.\n\n- **Underlying Themes Across the Discussion**  \n  1. **Equity:** Fair compensation for workers without shifting the burden onto customers.  \n  2. **Transparency:** Clear, non‑intrusive tipping interfaces that respect the customer’s choice.  \n  3. **Quality‑Based Reward:** Tips should be a reward for genuine service, not a default part of every transaction.  \n  4 **Economic Sustainability:** A system that provides predictable income for employees while removing the unpredictable, pressure‑filled nature of tip‑driven wages.\n\nIn sum, the collective sentiment leans heavily toward reforming the tipping ecosystem: making tips truly optional, tying them to service quality, and ensuring that workers receive a stable, livable wage independent of customer generosity.",
