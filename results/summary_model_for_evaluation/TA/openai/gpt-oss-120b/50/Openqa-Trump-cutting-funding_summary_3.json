    "main_points": "The comments coalesce around three broad perspectives:\n\n**1. Strong opposition to the cuts (the overwhelming majority).**  \n- Most respondents argue that reducing academic funding threatens the nation’s future by undermining basic education, research, and innovation.  \n- They stress that a well‑educated populace is essential for economic competitiveness, medical breakthroughs, and social mobility.  \n- Many link the cuts to short‑sightedness, political ideology, or an intent to keep the “general population” less informed, warning that the move could drive talent abroad and weaken U.S. institutions.  \n- A consistent thread is the concern that students—especially those from low‑income families—will lose critical resources, widening inequality and limiting opportunities.\n\n**2. Limited support or conditional approval (a small minority).**  \n- A few participants suggest that cuts might be justified if they curb wasteful spending, curb perceived left‑leaning bias in academia, or shift responsibility to state and local control.  \n- One comment frames the reduction as a necessary “freeze” on independent thinking, while another sees potential benefits in eliminating misuse of funds.\n\n**3. Neutral or uncertain viewpoints (very few).**  \n- A handful of respondents express the need for more information before forming an opinion or adopt a “wait‑and‑see” stance, emphasizing that the education system already requires overhaul.\n\n**Overall sentiment:** Approximately eight‑tenths of the feedback is critical of the funding reductions, highlighting risks to research, student outcomes, and national competitiveness. Roughly one‑tenth offers a cautiously supportive angle rooted in fiscal or ideological concerns, and the remaining few percent are neutral or undecided. The dominant narrative frames the cuts as detrimental to both short‑term educational access and long‑term societal progress.",
