    "main_points": "The comments paint a picture of AI as a powerful, everyday assistant that is reshaping how people work, learn, create and manage daily life.  \n\n**Positive impacts**  \n- Roughly three‑quarters of the respondents say AI has made their work faster and more efficient, letting them finish projects, write emails, draft proposals, edit photos, or complete homework in a fraction of the time it used to take.  \n- About two‑thirds highlight how AI simplifies research and information‑gathering: summaries, quick fact‑checks, and curated sources let them explore new topics, generate ideas for home‑renovations, passive‑income plans, or artistic concepts.  \n- Over half mention personal‑productivity gains such as better organization, voice‑dictation correction, personalized recommendations, and automated home‑control.  \n- A notable share (≈30 %) note improvements to mental‑well‑being: AI chatbots provide emotional support, tutoring, and motivation, which they say has made them feel healthier and more confident.  \n- Creative work is a recurring theme; many describe AI as a “co‑artist” that helps them draw, edit images, produce videos, or experiment with design ideas they previously found difficult.  \n\n**Negative or mixed feelings**  \n- Concerns about privacy and data tracking appear in roughly one‑third of the comments. Respondents worry that AI stores their searches, preferences, and personal information, sometimes feeling “watched” or vulnerable to misuse.  \n- Job‑security anxieties are expressed by about a quarter of participants, who fear that automation could displace their roles or make certain skills obsolete.  \n- Trust and accuracy issues are raised by a similar proportion: some users point out that AI can produce biased, outdated, or outright false information, forcing them to double‑check sources.  \n- Dependence and over‑reliance surface in roughly 15 % of the remarks. A few people describe feeling “addicted” to AI for simple tasks, fearing it erodes their own thinking or originality.  \n- The proliferation of deep‑fakes and synthetic media is mentioned by about 10 % of respondents, who say it makes it harder to discern what used to be “real” content.  \n\n**Overall tone**  \nThe prevailing sentiment is that AI has already become an indispensable productivity tool for most users, delivering speed, convenience, and creative inspiration. At the same time, a sizable minority voice caution about privacy, reliability, and the societal implications of widespread AI adoption. Many participants call for clearer regulations and ethical guidelines to balance these benefits with the emerging risks.",
