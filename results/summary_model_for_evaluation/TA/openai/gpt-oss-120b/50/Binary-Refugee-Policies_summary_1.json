    "main_points": "The discussion reveals a strong overall willingness to admit refugees fleeing war or persecution, with most participants framing the issue in moral and humanitarian terms. Many see accepting refugees as an expression of American values—freedom, compassion, and the nation’s historic role as a sanctuary. Several respondents emphasize that helping vulnerable people is a “human rights” responsibility, a way to demonstrate global leadership, and an opportunity for cultural enrichment and economic contribution, especially in less‑populated areas.\n\nA sizeable share of the supporters, however, attach conditions to their endorsement. The most common qualifiers involve thorough vetting and background checks to prevent the entry of criminals or security threats. Concerns about the capacity of public services and the potential strain on resources also appear frequently; participants who favor acceptance often stress that it should not undermine the well‑being of current citizens. Some suggest limits on numbers, prioritization of the most vulnerable (e.g., those facing immediate danger), or the need for adequate funding and infrastructure before expanding intake.\n\nOpposition is less prevalent but still notable. Critics argue that the United States is already burdened by debt, social‑service demands, and domestic challenges, and therefore should focus on its own population first. A few express frustration that illegal immigration already consumes resources, fearing that additional refugees would exacerbate the problem. A minority simply reject the idea, citing the need for other countries to shoulder the responsibility or questioning the practicality of large‑scale refugee resettlement.\n\nA small segment remains undecided or “on the fence,” acknowledging both the ethical imperative to protect people in danger and the practical worries about security, integration, and resource allocation. These respondents often call for clearer policies, balanced approaches, and robust support systems to reconcile compassion with national interests.\n\nIn summary, the consensus leans heavily toward supporting refugee admission, especially when framed as a humanitarian duty, but the majority of supporters want safeguards—rigorous vetting, resource planning, and limits—to ensure that assistance to refugees does not compromise the well‑being of American citizens. Opposition centers on fiscal and capacity concerns, while a minority remains ambivalent, seeking more information and policy clarity.",
