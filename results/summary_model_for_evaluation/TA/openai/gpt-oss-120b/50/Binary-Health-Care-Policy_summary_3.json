    "main_points": "The overwhelming majority of respondents favor a government‑provided health‑insurance system. Most argue that health care is a basic human right and that a public option would guarantee equal access regardless of income, employment status, or personal circumstance. Key motivations include:\n\n* **Equity and fairness** – Over three‑quarters view universal coverage as a matter of social justice, insisting that no one should have to choose between medical care and basic necessities such as food or housing.  \n* **Economic and productivity benefits** – Roughly half link universal coverage to a healthier workforce, reduced medical‑debt burdens, and enhanced national competitiveness, even framing health security as a matter of national security.  \n* **Cost‑effectiveness** – Many believe that a single‑payer or mixed public‑private system would lower overall health‑care spending, reduce administrative waste, and prevent bankruptcies caused by exorbitant private premiums.  \n* **International comparison** – A sizable share point to other developed nations that already offer universal or near‑universal care, using those examples to argue that the United States is lagging behind its peers.\n\nWhile support is strong, a minority of participants express reservations. Approximately one‑in‑ten are skeptical about the government’s ability to manage a large insurance program efficiently, worry about potential privacy or monitoring intrusions, or consider the fiscal impact. A small subset opposes any expansion on principle, citing a belief that government involvement inevitably leads to higher taxes and lower quality than a private‑sector market.\n\nIn sum, the collective sentiment leans heavily toward endorsing government‑funded basic health insurance, driven by concerns for fairness, economic stability, and comparative international standards, while acknowledging a modest but notable concern about cost, efficiency, and the role of government in health‑care delivery.",
