    "main_points": "The comments reveal a largely humanitarian orientation toward admitting refugees who are fleeing war or persecution, tempered by a consistent call for safeguards and realistic assessments of national capacity.\n\n**Broad support**  \nA clear majority of respondents endorse the United States taking in more refugees, emphasizing moral responsibility, compassion, and the nation’s historic identity as a haven for the oppressed. Many frame the policy as a matter of human rights, global solidarity, and an opportunity for cultural enrichment. The sentiment that “everyone deserves a safe place” or that helping refugees “shows how great and caring our government is” recurs frequently.\n\n**Conditional acceptance**  \nEven among supporters, a substantial proportion stress the need for rigorous vetting, background checks, and limits on numbers to protect national security and prevent strain on public services. Several comments specifically mention the importance of:\n- Screening for criminal histories or security threats.  \n- Ensuring refugees do not compete with citizens for scarce resources (housing, jobs, social services).  \n- Prioritizing vulnerable groups (e.g., children, women, victims of persecution) while excluding economic migrants.  \n- Providing adequate integration support such as education about U.S. laws and cultural norms.\n\n**Economic and capacity concerns**  \nA notable share of participants voice worries about the fiscal impact of expanding refugee admissions. These concerns highlight the country’s existing debt, social‑service burdens, and the need to first address domestic problems. Some argue that limited resources should be directed toward American citizens before extending aid abroad, while others suggest that the U.S. can leverage its wealth and infrastructure to accommodate newcomers, especially in less‑populated regions.\n\n**Opposition**  \nA smaller but vocal segment opposes increasing refugee intake altogether. Their arguments focus on:\n- Overcrowding and competition for resources.  \n- The belief that the U.S. is already “over‑immigrated” or that refugees arrive too quickly for proper vetting.  \n- A stance that the nation should prioritize solving its own internal issues before helping others.\n\n**Neutral or fence‑sitting positions**  \nA few respondents express ambivalence, acknowledging both the humanitarian imperative and the practical challenges. They call for a balanced approach that protects refugees while safeguarding citizens’ wellbeing.\n\n**Overall impression (estimated distribution)**  \n- Approximately **70 %** of the comments favor accepting more refugees, with the caveat that robust screening and resource management are essential.  \n- Roughly **20 %** oppose expanding refugee admissions, citing economic strain and domestic priorities.  \n- The remaining **10 %** adopt a neutral or undecided stance, seeking a middle ground.\n\nIn sum, the collective voice leans strongly toward humanitarian admission of refugees, provided that security checks, resource allocation, and integration planning are carefully addressed. Economic and capacity worries, as well as outright opposition, form the primary counter‑arguments.",
