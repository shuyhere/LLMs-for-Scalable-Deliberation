    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Strong Preference for Removing Mandatory Tipping**  \n  A clear majority of participants feel that tipping should no longer be compulsory. Many describe the current system as “forced,” “bullying,” or “out‑of‑hand,” especially when tips are requested for low‑value or self‑service transactions (e​.g., coffee pick‑up, pizza take‑out, tablet‑based POS prompts).  \n\n- **Link Between Tipping and Low Base Wages**  \n  Most commenters connect the prevalence of tipping to employers paying workers a sub‑living wage. The prevailing suggestion is to raise the hourly wage to a livable level (often framed as $15 / hour or at least the federal minimum), which would make tips truly optional and a reward for exceptional service rather than a necessity for survival.\n\n- **Alternative Compensation Models**  \n  - **Fixed Service Charge**: Several participants propose replacing discretionary tips with a flat, mandatory service charge (commonly 10 % or a set dollar amount such as $20–$30).  \n  - **Hybrid Approaches**: Some envision a system where a modest, predictable service fee is built into the bill, while customers retain the ability to add a “thank‑you” tip (e.g., a note, coupon, or small extra amount) if they wish.  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Tips**: A few suggest moving away from percentage‑based calculations toward preset tip amounts that are easier for customers to understand.\n\n- **Desire for Greater Transparency and Choice**  \n  Many call for POS interfaces to make a “no tip” option prominent and to only present tipping prompts when a clear service has been rendered. The goal is to prevent customers from feeling pressured before the service is evaluated.\n\n- **Scope of Who Should Be Tipped**  \n  Opinions diverge on which workers deserve tips. While some argue that tipping should be limited to full‑service restaurant staff, others expand the principle to any worker who provides a noticeable service (e.g., delivery drivers, bar staff). Conversely, several respondents assert that only those whose wages are already adequate should be eligible for tips.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons**  \n  A handful of comments reference practices in Europe or Japan, where service charges or higher base wages reduce the reliance on tipping. These examples are used to illustrate that a tipping‑free model is feasible.\n\n- **Support for Tipping When Service Is Exceptional**  \n  About a quarter of the comments still view tipping positively, seeing it as an incentive for high‑quality service and a way to reward staff who go “above and beyond.” These participants typically favor a voluntary, performance‑based tip rather than a blanket expectation.\n\n- **Potential Improvements Beyond Compensation**  \n  Some suggestions aim to enhance the tip‑giving experience itself, such as providing a written thank‑you‑don’t‑need‑to‑tip‑but‑appreciate‑the‑service note, or offering a coupon for a future visit as a token of gratitude.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Eliminate coercive or default tipping prompts** and make any tip truly optional.  \n- **Raise base wages** to a livable level so that tips become a genuine reward rather than a wage supplement.  \n- **Consider a modest, transparent service charge** (e.g., 10 %) that can replace the need for discretionary tips, while still allowing customers to add a voluntary gratuity for exceptional service.  \n- **Limit tipping to contexts where a clear, personal service is provided**, such as sit‑down restaurants, and avoid extending it to self‑service or low‑value transactions.  \n- **Improve POS design** to prominently display “no tip” choices and only solicit tips after service has been rendered.  \n\nOverall, the consensus leans toward a system where tipping is optional, tied to service quality, and complemented—or replaced—by fair, consistent wages for workers.",
