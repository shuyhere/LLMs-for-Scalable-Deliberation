    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Strong Preference for Reducing or Eliminating Mandatory Tipping**  \n  A clear majority of the contributors (around 70 %) want the current “default‑tip” prompts removed or made truly optional. Many describe the practice as “orchestrated pressure” that forces customers to tip even for minimal or self‑service transactions (e.g., pick‑up pizza, coffee, drive‑through). Several suggestions focus on redesigning point‑of‑sale screens so that a “no tip” option is prominent from the start.\n\n- **Link Between Tipping and Low Base Wages**  \n  Roughly two‑thirds of the respondents connect the prevalence of tipping to employers paying workers below a livable wage. The most common remedy proposed is that all service staff receive a guaranteed, livable hourly wage (often cited as $15 / hour or at least the federal minimum). When this condition is met, many say tipping could become optional or disappear entirely.\n\n- **Preferred Alternatives to the Current Model**  \n  - **Flat Service Charge** – About 30 % of the comments suggest replacing discretionary tips with a fixed, modest service charge (commonly 10 %‑15 %) that is automatically added to the bill, similar to practices in Japan or many European countries.  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Tips** – A smaller group (≈ 15 %) advocates moving away from percentage‑based calculations toward set dollar amounts (e.g., $20‑$30 for a or a $5‑$10 range for smaller bills).  \n  - **Reward‑Based Tipping** – Some participants (≈ 10 %) propose that tips be accompanied by a tangible token of appreciation, such as a thank‑you note or a coupon for a future visit.\n\n- **Conditional Support for Tipping**  \n  While many want to curb compulsory tipping, a sizable portion (around 60 %) still views tipping as a legitimate way to reward **good** service. These contributors stress that tips should be earned, not assumed, and should be limited to situations where staff provide direct, personalized service (e.g., sit‑down dining). They often contrast this with “fast‑food” or self‑service contexts, where they feel tipping is inappropriate.\n\n- **Cultural and Regional Comparisons**  \n  Several voices point to European or Asian models where tipping is either unnecessary or handled via an inclusive service charge. About 20 % of the comments suggest the United States could adopt similar structures, arguing that the current system is uniquely burdensome for American consumers.\n\n- **Critiques of the System’s Impact on Workers and Consumers**  \n  - **For Workers** – Many see tipping as a “necessary evil” that compensates for historically low‑wage employment. Some (≈ 15 %) argue that tips can actually benefit workers by allowing them to exceed the minimum wage when service is excellent.  \n  - **For Consumers** – A comparable share (≈ 15 %) note that the omnipresent tip prompts create stress, confusion, and a feeling of obligation, especially when budgets are tight. The perception that “everyone expects a tip” is described as out of control.\n\n- **Consensus on the Need for Reform**  \n  Across the spectrum, there is a broad consensus that the tipping system as it stands is flawed and in need of change. Whether through higher base wages, a universal service charge, or a more transparent optional‑tip interface, participants largely agree that the current practice places undue pressure on both customers and employees.",
