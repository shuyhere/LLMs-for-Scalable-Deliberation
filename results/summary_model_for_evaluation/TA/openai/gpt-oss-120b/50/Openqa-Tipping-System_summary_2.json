    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Discontent with Mandatory or “Automatic” Tipping**  \n  A large majority of participants feel that the current system pushes tipping onto customers in situations where it isn’t warranted (e.g., pickup orders, coffee counters, fast‑food venues, or low‑value transactions). Many describe the experience as *pressured*, *bullying*, or *out of hand* and would like the option to decline or to see a clearly visible “no tip” button.\n\n- **Desire for a Living Wage Instead of Reliance on Tips**  \n  Roughly three‑quarters of the responses argue that workers—especially restaurant servers—should receive a livable, minimum wage that eliminates the need to depend on tips for basic income. Several commenters suggest that a higher base wage or a mandatory service charge (often 10 % or a fixed amount) would make tipping truly optional and fair.\n\n- **Support for Tipping When It Reflects Service Quality**  \n  About half of the contributors still see value in tipping as a reward for good service. They favor a system where the tip is earned, possibly expressed through fixed amounts rather than percentages, or accompanied by a tangible acknowledgment (e.g., a thank‑you note or a coupon).\n\n- **Proposals for Structural Changes**  \n  - **Service‑Charge Model:** Many propose replacing discretionary tips with a flat, pre‑added service charge (10 % is frequently mentioned), similar to practices in Japan or Europe.  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Tips:** Some suggest moving away from percentage‑based calculations toward standard dollar amounts (e.g., $20‑$30 for a typical meal).  \n  - **Limited Scope:** Several participants recommend restricting tipping to full‑service, sit‑down restaurants and removing it from self‑service or take‑out contexts.  \n  - **Improved POS Design:** A notable share calls for point‑of‑sale interfaces that make “no tip” easy to select and that only present tipping prompts when the service provided justifies it.\n\n- **Cultural and Ethical Perspectives**  \n  A minority of commenters point out that the United States is unique in its heavy reliance on tipping, citing European models where wages are higher and tips are optional. Some view tipping as a “necessary evil” that incentivizes better service, while others see it as an exploitative practice that lets employers underpay staff.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment**  \n  The prevailing sentiment is that the tipping system, as it stands, is overly intrusive and tied to low wages. Most participants would like to see it restructured—either by making it truly optional, coupling it with a guaranteed livable wage, or replacing it with a transparent service charge—while preserving the ability to reward exceptional service when appropriate.",
