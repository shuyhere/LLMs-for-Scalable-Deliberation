    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Perceived Impact:** The overwhelming majority of the remarks view the tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society. Roughly **70 %** of the comments describe a **negative impact**, highlighting higher consumer prices, inflation, reduced purchasing power, and strain on small businesses. About **20 %** of the statements anticipate **positive outcomes**, often pointing to potential long‑term benefits such as increased government revenue, protection of certain domestic industries, or eventual job creation. The remaining **10 %** present a **mixed or neutral view**, acknowledging both possible costs and benefits.\n\n- **Key Concerns (Negative Themes)**\n  - **Higher Prices & Inflation:** Many respondents stress that tariffs act like a tax on consumers, pushing up the cost of everyday goods and making life harder for middle‑ and low‑income households.\n  - **Small‑Business Strain:** Numerous comments note that small firms are especially vulnerable, with higher input costs and limited ability to absorb tariffs.\n  - **Trade Relations & Retaliation:** A recurring worry is that tariffs damage diplomatic and commercial ties, prompting other countries to impose counter‑tariffs and reducing overall trade flows.\n  - **Questionable Effectiveness:** Critics argue that tariffs have not succeeded in reshoring manufacturing, that companies continue to source a large share of goods from abroad, and that the expected job gains are slow or uncertain.\n  - **Economic Uncertainty:** Several participants link the policy to broader macro‑economic risks, such as slower growth, reduced investment, and a heightened chance of recession.\n\n- **Positive Expectations (Supportive Themes)**\n  - **Revenue Generation:** Some see the tariffs as a source of federal revenue that can help reduce deficits.\n  - **Domestic Industry Protection:** A subset believes that shielding certain sectors could eventually foster a more competitive U.S. manufacturing base.\n  - **Long‑Term Strategic Gains:** A few comments suggest that short‑run pain may be offset by future trade deals, better bargaining power, or a more self‑sufficient economy.\n\n- **Mixed or Conditional Views**\n  - **Short‑Term Pain vs. Long‑Term Gain:** A minority acknowledge immediate negative effects but remain hopeful that the policy could yield benefits after an adjustment period.\n  - **Sector‑Specific Outcomes:** Some observations note that while some industries may suffer, others could gain from reduced foreign competition.\n\n- **Overall Sentiment:** The collective voice leans heavily toward skepticism about the tariff strategy’s current effectiveness, with price increases and consumer burden cited as the most immediate and tangible consequences. Optimism‑oriented comments are largely forward‑looking, emphasizing potential fiscal or strategic advantages that have yet to materialize.",
