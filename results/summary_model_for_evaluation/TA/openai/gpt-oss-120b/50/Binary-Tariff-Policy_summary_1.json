    "main_points": "The discussion is dominated by concerns that the current tariff policy is hurting the U.S. economy and society. Most participants (about three‑quarters) argue that tariffs are raising prices for consumers, squeezing small‑business margins, and straining trade relationships. They point to higher everyday‑good costs, delayed or canceled shipments, and a growing sense that the burden falls on ordinary households—especially lower‑income families—while any benefits appear distant or limited.\n\nA smaller share of respondents (roughly one‑fifth) see potential upside. These comments emphasize that tariffs could eventually boost federal revenue, protect certain domestic industries, encourage “buy‑American” behavior, and lay groundwork for longer‑term fiscal stability or job creation. However, even among the more optimistic voices, the benefits are framed as future‑oriented and contingent on broader policy adjustments.\n\nA minority (around ten percent) describe the impact as mixed. They acknowledge short‑term price pressures and uncertainty but suggest that, with time, tariffs might help reduce the trade deficit, protect specific sectors, or improve bargaining power in negotiations with other countries.\n\nKey themes emerging across the comments include:\n\n* **Consumer price inflation** – the most frequently cited effect, with many noting that tariffs act like a tax passed on to shoppers.\n* **Small‑business vulnerability** – numerous participants describe heightened costs, reduced competitiveness, and even business closures.\n* **Trade‑partner relations** – several comments warn that retaliatory measures and weakened diplomatic ties could further erode economic stability.\n* **Long‑run fiscal or strategic gains** – the positive outlooks, when present, focus on potential revenue gains, reshoring of jobs, and a more balanced trade position, but these are described as uncertain and far off.\n* **Political framing** – a number of statements link the tariffs to broader judgments about the administration’s approach, describing the policy as either “aggressive,” “isolationist,” or “beneficial for the wealthy.”\n\nOverall, the sentiment is that while a handful of participants hope for eventual strategic benefits, the prevailing view is that the tariff policy is presently generating higher costs for consumers, harming small businesses, and creating trade friction that outweighs any short‑term fiscal advantages.",
