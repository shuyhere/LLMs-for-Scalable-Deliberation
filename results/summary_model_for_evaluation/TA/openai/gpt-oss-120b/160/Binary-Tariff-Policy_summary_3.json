    "main_points": "The discussion of the Trump‑era tariff policy is dominated by concerns that the measures are hurting the United States’ economy and its citizens.  \n\n**Key points raised**\n\n* **Higher consumer prices** – The most frequently mentioned effect is that tariffs are being passed on to shoppers, driving up the cost of everyday goods, groceries, gasoline and imported products. Many respondents linked this price pressure to reduced purchasing power, lower consumer spending and a risk of inflation outpacing the modest gains the tariffs might generate.  \n\n* **Impact on businesses** – Small‑business owners and entrepreneurs repeatedly noted that higher import duties raise their input costs, squeeze margins and, in some cases, force them to cut back or close. Larger firms were described as either absorbing the costs, delaying investment, or seeking work‑arounds such as bulk buying before the tariffs took effect.  \n\n* **Trade relations and retaliation** – A sizable share of the comments warned that the tariffs are damaging diplomatic and trade ties, prompting other countries to consider retaliatory measures that could further harm U.S. exporters and the broader global supply chain.  \n\n* **Mixed or conditional benefits** – A minority of participants pointed to potential long‑run advantages: protecting certain domestic industries (e.g., steel, aluminum), encouraging reshoring of production, and generating additional federal revenue that could be used to reduce the deficit or fund other priorities. Some expressed optimism that, after an initial adjustment period, the policy might help rebalance trade and create jobs.  \n\n* **Short‑term versus long‑term outlook** – Many respondents distinguished between an immediate negative shock—chiefly higher prices and uncertainty—and a more speculative, longer‑term payoff. Even among those who saw possible future gains, the consensus was that the short‑run costs are substantial and felt most acutely by average consumers and small firms.  \n\n* **Perceived motivation and fairness** – Several comments framed the tariffs as politically driven, benefiting a narrow set of interests (e.g., the administration or certain industries) while imposing broad burdens on the public. A few described the approach as an “economic weapon” that undermines the U.S.’s reputation as a reliable trading partner.  \n\n**Overall sentiment**\n\nRoughly four‑fifths of the feedback characterizes the tariff policy as having a **negative impact** on both the economy and society, emphasizing price inflation, strain on small businesses, and deteriorating trade relationships. About one‑quarter of the remarks acknowledge possible **positive effects**—mainly protection of specific sectors, revenue gains and potential long‑term reshoring—though these are typically qualified by the expectation of short‑term hardships.  \n\nIn sum, the prevailing view is that the tariffs are currently more harmful than helpful, with any prospective benefits seen as uncertain and likely to materialize only after a painful adjustment period.",
