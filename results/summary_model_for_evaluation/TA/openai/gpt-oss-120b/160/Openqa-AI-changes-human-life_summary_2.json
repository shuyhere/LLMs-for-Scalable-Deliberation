    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Positive impact on productivity and efficiency** – The majority of respondents (roughly 65 %) describe AI as a powerful productivity booster. People repeatedly mention that AI speeds up routine work, automates repetitive tasks, and condenses research or summarisation into a few seconds. Typical examples include drafting emails, creating résumés, generating titles or product descriptions, planning events, and handling homework or school assignments.\n\n- **Support for learning and problem‑solving** – Around 55 % of the comments highlight AI as a personal tutor or study aid. Users note that it helps them understand complex concepts, solve math problems, learn new languages, and acquire technical knowledge (e.g., coding, data analysis). The “instant‑answer” feature is repeatedly praised for making self‑directed learning feel more accessible.\n\n- **Creative assistance** – Approximately 45 % of participants mention using AI for artistic or creative work. This includes image generation, graphic design, brainstorming story ideas, music or video production, and enhancing personal art projects. For many, AI serves as an “idea partner” that helps overcome writer’s block or visual‑design hurdles.\n\n- **Convenience in everyday life** – Roughly 40 % of the remarks point to AI’s role in day‑to‑day convenience: voice assistants for calls and directions, quick recipe or meal‑plan suggestions, health‑related queries, home‑automation, and rapid fact‑checking. Several users also cite AI as a source of emotional support or casual conversation.\n\n- **Mixed or limited impact** – About 15 % of the comments describe AI as an optional tool that has not dramatically altered their lives. Some participants use it only for occasional queries, treat it as a “Google‑plus‑features” service, or feel that the technology has not yet reached a level where it changes their routine.\n\n- **Concerns and negative perceptions** – A notable minority (around 30 %) express worries about privacy, data security, and the amount of personal information that AI can collect. Job‑security anxieties appear in roughly 25 % of the responses, with users fearing automation of their roles. Trust issues are also common: participants note that AI can produce inaccurate or biased information, generate deep‑fakes, or diminish critical‑thinking skills. Environmental impact and the ethical implications of AI‑generated art or content are mentioned by about 10 % of the commenters.\n\n- **Overall sentiment** – While most participants view AI as a beneficial assistant that makes work and personal tasks easier, a substantial portion remains cautious, emphasizing the need for verification, ethical safeguards, and thoughtful integration to avoid over‑reliance or unintended harm.",
