    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant perception:** The overwhelming majority of respondents view the current tariff policy as detrimental to the U.S. economy and society.  \n  - **Key concerns:**  \n    - **Higher consumer prices** – most comments note that tariffs raise the cost of everyday goods, squeeze household budgets and fuel inflation.  \n    - **Impact on small businesses** – many note that higher input costs and reduced demand are hurting entrepreneurs and artisans who rely on a global supply chain.  \n    - **Trade‑relationship strain** – a large share cite deteriorating ties with China and other trading partners, retaliation, and a loss of the United States’ reputation as a fair trading partner.  \n    - **Uncertainty and investment slowdown** – several participants mention that the unpredictable, “capricious” nature of the tariffs discourages corporate investment and could slow long‑term growth.\n\n- **Perceived benefits (minority view):** A smaller segment sees potential upside, usually framed in long‑term or conditional terms.  \n  - **Protecting domestic industries** – a few argue that tariffs can shield certain sectors (e.g., steel, aluminum) and encourage reshoring of production.  \n  - **Revenue generation** – some point to the additional tariff receipts that could reduce deficits or fund government programs.  \n  - **Strategic leverage** – a handful view tariffs as a bargaining tool to force fairer trade terms with countries that have historically “taken advantage” of the U.S.\n\n- **Mixed or conditional opinions:** About one‑tenth of the comments acknowledge both short‑term pain and possible long‑term gains. These respondents often stress that any benefits will depend on how the policy is targeted, how quickly firms adapt‑to‑new costs, and whether complementary measures (e.g., trade negotiations, domestic investment) are pursued.\n\n- **Overall sentiment distribution (approximate):**  \n  - **Negative impact:** roughly eight‑tenths of the comments.  \n  - **Positive impact (or potential future benefit):** roughly one‑quarter of the comments.  \n  - **Mixed/conditional:** the remaining minority.\n\n- **Common themes across all viewpoints:**  \n  - **Consumer burden** is the most frequently mentioned effect.  \n  - **Small‑business vulnerability** is highlighted repeatedly.  \n  - **Trade‑partner retaliation** and **global supply‑chain disruption** appear in many critiques.  \n  - **Potential for domestic job creation** is the primary argument among those favoring the policy, though most see this as a distant or uncertain outcome.\n\nIn sum, while a small group believes tariffs could eventually protect certain industries and raise government revenue, the prevailing view is that the policy is currently raising prices, hurting consumers and small firms, and damaging U.S. trade relationships, leading to a net negative impact on the economy and society.",
