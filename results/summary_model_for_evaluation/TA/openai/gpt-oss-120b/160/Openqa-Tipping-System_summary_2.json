    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation on the tipping system**\n\n- **Broad consensus for change** – A large majority of the comments (about 70 %) call for the current tipping model to be re‑structured so that workers are not dependent on customer gratuities. The most common proposals are:  \n  * Mandating a livable base wage for all service‑industry employees (≈ 55 % of the remarks).  \n  * Eliminating mandatory or pre‑selected tip options on point‑of‑sale screens (≈ 45 %).  \n\n- **Tip as an optional reward** – Roughly 60 % of participants say that tipping to a server or delivery person should remain a voluntary gesture tied to the quality of service. Many suggest that tips be offered only after the service is rendered, and that the “tip‑now” prompt be removed for transactions that involve little or no personal service (e.g., coffee pick‑up, fast‑food orders, self‑service kiosks).\n\n- **Preferred alternatives to the percentage‑based model** – About 20 % of the responses favor replacing the usual percentage sliders with either:  \n  * Fixed dollar amounts (e.g., a $20–$30 standard tip for a full‑service meal).  \n  * A modest, uniform service charge (often cited as 10 %) that would be baked into the bill, similar to practices in Japan or parts of Europe.  \n\n- **Cultural comparisons** – A noticeable share of the discussion (≈ 15 %) points to European or other international systems where tipping is rare because employers pay higher wages. Commenters who favor this model also tend to view tipping as an “unnecessary” cultural relic in the United States.\n\n- **Enhancements rather than elimination** – A smaller segment (≈ 10 %) does not want to abolish tipping altogether but proposes refinements, such as a token of appreciation:  \n  * Providing a thank‑you note or a small coupon with the tip.  \n  * Making the “no tip” button clearly visible and easy to select on digital menus.  \n  * Allowing customers to rate service first, then decide on a tip amount.\n\n- **Concerns about fairness and predictability** – Across the board, participants express that the current system places an unfair burden on both customers (who feel pressured) and workers (who face unpredictable income). The recurring theme is that tipping should supplement, not replace, a fair wage.\n\n- **Key take‑aways for policy makers or businesses**  \n  1. **Decouple compensation from gratuities** – Adopt a wage floor that meets living‑cost standards for all service roles.  \n  2. **Make tipping truly optional** – Remove default tip prompts for non‑service transactions and ensure a “0 %” option is prominent.  \n  3. **Consider a modest, universal service charge** – This can simplify billing and reduce the social pressure to tip while still rewarding good service.  \n  4. **Educate customers** – Clarify that tipping is a voluntary gratitude gesture, not an obligatory surcharge.  \n\nOverall, the “tipping culture” is viewed as increasingly intrusive and tied to low wages. Most respondents advocate either eliminating mandatory tipping or reforming it so that gratuities become an optional, service‑based reward while employers assume responsibility for a stable, livable income.",
