    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe discussion reveals a strong consensus that the current tipping system in the United States places an unfair burden on both customers and workers.  \n\n**Key Concerns**\n\n- **Mandatory or “soft‑mandatory” prompts** – A large majority of respondents feel that tip screens on point‑of‑sale devices, especially for low‑service transactions (e.g., coffee, take‑out, self‑service), create pressure to tip even when no substantial service is rendered. Many argue that a clear, easily accessible “$0” option should be the default.  \n\n- **Reliance on tips to compensate low wages** – Most participants point out that tipped employees, particularly restaurant servers, are often paid far below a livable wage (often the federal minimum of $2.13/hour). The prevailing view is that tipping should be a bonus for exceptional service, not a substitute for a fair base salary.  \n\n- **Over‑extension of tipping culture** – Respondents note that tipping requests have spread beyond full‑service restaurants to fast‑food counters, delivery apps, and even retail purchases. This “tip‑every‑thing” mentality is seen as excessive and, in many cases, inappropriate.  \n\n- **Desire for optional, service‑based tipping** – When tipping is retained, commenters overwhelmingly agree it should be purely discretionary and tied to the quality of service. Fixed‑amount suggestions (e.g., a $20–$30 standard tip) or a lower baseline (around 10 % for average service, 15 %+ for excellent service) are frequently mentioned as possible improvements.  \n\n- **Alternative structures** – A sizable portion of the feedback favors replacing the tip‑percentage model with either:  \n  * a modest, mandatory service charge (often cited at 10 %) that is baked into the bill, or  \n  * a European‑style approach where employers pay a livable wage and tipping becomes truly optional.  \n\n- **Potential incentives for better service** – Some participants suggest that modest, optional tips (or thank‑you notes, coupons, etc.) could still encourage high‑quality service without making tips a required part of compensation.  \n\n**Common Recommendations**\n\n1. **Eliminate mandatory tipping** – Move tip prompts to an optional layer, with a default “no tip” selection.  \n2. **Raise base wages** – Ensure tipped workers receive at least a livable minimum wage, reducing dependence on customer gratuities.  \n3. **Restrict tipping to genuine service interactions** – Limit tip requests to full‑service settings (sit‑down restaurants, delivery, personal care) and remove them from self‑service or low‑effort transactions.  \n4. **Simplify the interface** – Offer clear, low‑percentage or fixed‑amount options, and make a $0 choice prominent and easy to select.  \n5. **Consider a modest service charge** – A small, uniform charge could replace the tip‑percentage system, providing predictable income for staff while keeping gratuities truly voluntary.  \n\nOverall, the sentiment is that tipping, while appreciated for rewarding excellent service, has become over‑expected and is being used to mask inadequate wages. The preferred direction is toward a system where workers receive a fair, stable salary and tipping remains an optional expression of gratitude rather than an obligatory component of compensation.",
