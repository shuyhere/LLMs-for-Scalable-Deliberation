    "main_points": "**Overall Assessment**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the remarks view the current U.S. tariff policy as harmful to the economy and to society. Most participants point to rising consumer prices, strained small‑business operations, and deteriorating trade relationships as the chief problems. A smaller but noticeable share of comments highlight potential or hoped‑for benefits—such as additional government revenue, protection of certain domestic industries, and the prospect of reshoring jobs—often framing these as long‑term or conditional gains. A few respondents adopt a neutral or mixed stance, acknowledging both short‑term pains and possible future advantages.\n\n**Key Themes**\n\n|**Negative Sentiment (≈ 80 %)**  \n- **Higher Prices & Inflation:** Repeatedly cited that tariffs act as a tax on imported goods, which is passed on to consumers, eroding purchasing power and driving up the cost of everyday items (food, gasoline, household goods).  \n- **Impact on Small Businesses & Consumers:** Small firms that rely on imported inputs report tighter margins, reduced order volumes, and in some cases the inability to source key materials. Consumers are described as “the ones paying the tariffs.”  \n- **Trade Relations & Retaliation:** Many note worsening diplomatic ties, especially with China, and the risk of reciprocal tariffs that could further depress exports and investment.  \n- **Economic Uncertainty & Investment:** The unpredictable nature of the tariffs is said to deter corporate investment and create broader uncertainty, potentially slowing growth.  \n- **Limited Job Creation:** While some argue tariffs could protect jobs, most comments observe little to no immediate employment benefit, and in several cases note job losses or stagnation.\n\n**Positive Sentiment (≈ 15 %)**  \n- **Revenue Generation:** Some respondents point to the sizable tariff collections, suggesting the funds could help reduce deficits or fund other priorities.  \n- **Domestic Industry Protection:** A few highlight that the policy shields certain sectors (e.g., steel, aluminum) and may encourage reshoring of production over the long run.  \n- **Strategic Leverage:** A minority view tariffs as a bargaining tool to force fairer trade terms with other nations, potentially yielding future gains.  \n\n**Mixed/Conditional Views (≈ 5 %)**  \n- **Short‑Term Pain, Long‑Term Gain:** Several commenters acknowledge immediate price pressures but argue that, once supply chains adjust, the economy could benefit from reduced dependence on foreign imports.  \n- **Sector‑Specific Effects:** Some note that while consumers bear higher costs, particular industries may experience modest improvements, creating a nuanced picture.\n\n**Overall Takeaway**\n\nThe consensus is that, at present, the tariff policy imposes significant costs on consumers and small businesses, harms trade relationships, and offers limited immediate economic upside. While a modest segment sees potential long‑term strategic or fiscal benefits, these expectations are largely framed as speculative or contingent on future adjustments. The prevailing sentiment therefore leans strongly toward a negative evaluation of the policy’s impact on both the U.S. economy and broader society.",
