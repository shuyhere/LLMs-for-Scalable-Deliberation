    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Broad Consensus on Reform**  \n  A clear majority of contributors feel that the current tipping system is **over‑extended** and places undue pressure on both customers and workers. Many describe it as “mandatory,” “forced,” or “expected for every transaction,” even when no meaningful service is provided (e.g., pick‑up orders, coffee counters, fast‑food venues).\n\n- **Key Criticisms**  \n  1. **Reliance on Tips to Bridge Low Wages** – Most respondents point to the fact that many service workers are paid far below a livable wage, so tips become a necessary part of their income rather than a genuine bonus.  \n  2. **Technology‑Driven Prompting** – The prevalence of tablet or digital payment screens that default to pre‑selected tip percentages (often starting at 15 % or higher) is widely criticized as intrusive and makes saying “no tip” difficult.  \n  3. **Inconsistent Application** – Participants note that tips are being solicited for tasks that traditionally required no gratuity (e.g., self‑service, drive‑through, retail purchases), which they view as an unfair expansion of the practice.\n\n- **Preferred Alternatives & Improvements**  \n  - **Living‑Wage Guarantee** – Over two‑thirds of the comments call for employers to pay a **livable base wage** (often referenced as $15 / hour or at least the federal minimum) so that tips become truly optional.  \n  - **Fixed Service Charge** – A sizable share suggest replacing discretionary tips with a modest, **standardized service charge** (commonly 10 % or a flat dollar amount) that is automatically included in the bill, similar to practices in Japan and parts of Europe.  \n  - **Optional/Voluntary Tipping** – Many advocate for a **clear “no tip” option** on payment interfaces, with tip prompts appearing only after service has been rendered and only in settings where direct, personal service is provided (e.g., sit‑down restaurants, delivery).  \n  - **Reward‑Based Enhancements** – Some ideas include offering **thank‑you notes, coupons, or other small tokens** to acknowledge the tip, making the gesture feel more reciprocal rather than obligatory.  \n  - **Fixed‑Amount Model** – A minority proposes moving away from percentage‑based suggestions to **preset dollar amounts** (e.g., $20 for a typical dinner) to simplify decisions and reduce psychological pressure.\n\n- **Support for Tipping When Earned**  \n  While many call for reform or elimination, a notable portion still values tipping as a **means of rewarding excellent service**. These participants generally agree that tips should be **discretionary** and tied to the quality of the interaction, not automatically imposed.\n\n- **Cultural Comparisons**  \n  Several comments reference **European or Asian models** where employees receive higher base pay and tipping is minimal or optional. These examples are frequently cited as evidence that a **different wage structure** can reduce reliance on gratuities.\n\n- **Overall Direction**  \n  The collective sentiment leans toward **reducing or removing mandatory tipping**, ensuring workers receive a **fair, stable wage**, and preserving tipping as a **voluntary expression of appreciation** for truly exceptional service. The suggested reforms aim to make tipping **less invasive**, **more transparent**, and **fairer** for both customers and employees.",
