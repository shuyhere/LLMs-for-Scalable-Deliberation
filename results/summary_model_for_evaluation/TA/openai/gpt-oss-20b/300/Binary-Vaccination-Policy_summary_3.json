    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA large majority of respondents view government‑enforced vaccination and quarantine as necessary during severe epidemics, citing public‑health protection, herd immunity, and historical precedent as key reasons. About a fifth express strong opposition, framing mandates as an infringement on bodily autonomy, a breach of trust, and a potential overreach that could lead to abuse. The remaining few adopt a conditional stance, supporting enforcement only when a disease is demonstrably severe, well‑studied, or when the government can guarantee safety and transparency.  \n\n**Key themes**\n\n| Theme | Supporting Arguments | Opposing Arguments |\n|-------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **Public safety & herd immunity** | Vaccines prevent disease spread; mandatory policies can accelerate herd immunity and protect vulnerable groups. | Mandates may create backlash, reduce vaccine uptake, or erode trust in public institutions. |\n| **Historical precedent** | Past successful mandates (e.g., smallpox, polio) reduced mortality. | History also shows misuse of public‑health powers for political ends. |\n| **Individual autonomy** | Some view vaccination as a personal right; mandates violate bodily integrity. | Others believe collective health sometimes outweighs individual choice, especially when the risk is high. |\n| **Safety & efficacy concerns** | Calls for rigorous safety data and transparent communication. | Fear of rushed or untested vaccines, side‑effects, and potential long‑term harm. |\n| **Government trust & accountability** | Supporters trust health agencies and see them as experts. | Skeptics doubt government motives, citing past mismanagement or political interference. |\n| **Scope and limits** | Preference for state‑level or flexible mandates, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. | Opposition to any compulsory enforcement, often advocating for voluntary compliance. |\n\n**Percentages (approximate)**\n\n- **Supportive**: ~70 % of comments advocate for or accept government enforcement of vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics.  \n- **Opposing**: ~20 % reject mandates, emphasizing personal freedom and safety concerns.  \n- **Conditional/nuanced**: ~10 % call for enforcement only under specific, stringent conditions (e.g., proven severity, proven safety, transparent processes).  \n\nThese patterns reflect a tension between collective public‑health goals and individual liberties, with most respondents leaning toward collective action in the face of serious disease threats.",
