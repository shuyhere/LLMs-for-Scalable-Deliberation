Roughly **70 %** highlight these benefits, citing easier content creation, quicker problem‑solving, and improved organization.\n\nA sizable minority—about **25 %**—express **concerns**. These include worries about data privacy, the accuracy of AI outputs, and the potential erosion of critical thinking or job security. Some feel that AI’s presence has made them more skeptical of online information and more wary of its pervasive influence.\n\nA smaller group, around **5 %**, report **negligible or no impact** on their daily lives, often noting that they use AI only sporadically or prefer traditional methods.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Productivity & Convenience**: AI is widely adopted for drafting, summarizing, and automating routine tasks, leading to perceived time savings and greater efficiency.  \n- **Creative Support**: Many use AI for design, writing, and idea generation, noting a boost in creative output.  \n- **Information Access**: Respondents appreciate AI’s ability to provide tailored answers and quick summaries, reducing the need to sift through multiple search results.  \n- **Trust & Accuracy Issues**: Several comments flag misinformation, hallucinations, or bias, prompting the need for fact‑checking and caution.  \n- **Privacy & Job Concerns**: A notable proportion are uneasy about data collection and the threat of automation to their employment.  \n- **Mixed or Minimal Impact**: A few users either remain indifferent or use AI only in limited contexts.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans toward **positive utility** tempered by **valid apprehensions about reliability, privacy, and long‑term societal effects**.",
