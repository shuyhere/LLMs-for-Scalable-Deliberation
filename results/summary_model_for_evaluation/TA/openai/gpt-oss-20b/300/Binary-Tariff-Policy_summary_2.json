    "main_points": "The responses overwhelmingly emphasize that the tariff policy is harming the U.S. economy.  \n- **Negative impact**: about three‑quarters of the comments highlight higher consumer prices, inflation, supply‑chain disruptions, and damage to small businesses and the broader economy.  \n- **Positive or hopeful views**: roughly one‑fifth of participants see potential long‑term gains—such as increased revenue for the Treasury, job creation in domestic manufacturing, and a more level playing field with trade partners.  \n- **Mixed or uncertain opinions**: the remaining portion acknowledges short‑term pain but believes the policy could eventually benefit the economy, or notes that the overall effect depends on how the tariffs are implemented and sustained.\n\nCommon threads include concern over consumer costs, retaliation from trading partners, and the question of whether the policy will actually bring jobs back to the United States. Overall, the dominant sentiment is that the tariffs have a net negative effect, with a minority trusting in eventual benefits.",
