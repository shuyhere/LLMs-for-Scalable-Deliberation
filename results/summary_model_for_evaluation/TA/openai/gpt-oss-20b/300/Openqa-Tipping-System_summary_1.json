    "main_points": "**Key take‑aways from the discussion**\n\n- **Majority view tipping as over‑extended and burdensome.**  \n  A large share of respondents feel that the expectation to tip has spread to almost every type of service, from coffee shops to grocery stores, and that this is unfair to both customers and workers.  \n\n- **Strong demand for a living wage.**  \n  Many commenters argue that tipped workers—especially restaurant servers—receive wages far below a livable standard and that employers should raise base pay instead of relying on customer generosity.  \n\n- **Preference for optional or “service‑only” tipping.**  \n  Several respondents want tipping to be reserved for situations where a person provides personal, attentive service (e.g., a waiter or delivery driver). They propose removing or reducing the automatic tip options that appear on point‑of‑sale devices for self‑service or minimal‑service contexts.  \n\n- **Skepticism about the current U.S. system.**  \n  A notable portion cite the U.S. as the only country that still relies on tips for a significant portion of service‑industry income, contrasting it with European models where tipping is largely unnecessary.  \n\n- **Support for a “service charge” alternative.**  \n  A smaller, but still significant, fraction suggest replacing the tip mechanism with a flat service fee (often around 10 %) that is built into the menu price or bill, making the cost transparent and reducing the pressure on customers.  \n\n- **Mixed feelings about tipping’s value.**  \n  While many express discomfort with the system, a considerable number still see tipping as a useful incentive for exceptional service and want to maintain it, provided workers are paid a fair hourly wage.  \n\n- **Calls for clearer policies and better communication.**  \n  Some commenters recommend that businesses clearly indicate when a tip is optional, when it is expected, and how tipping funds are distributed to staff.  \n\n**Overall sentiment**  \nA majority lean toward reforming or ending the current tipping culture, favoring higher base wages and clearer, optional tipping practices, while a minority continue to defend tipping as a necessary reward for good service—though they also support raising wages to reduce reliance on tips.",
