    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly favor government‑provided basic health insurance, with only a small minority expressing opposition or significant reservations.  \n\n**Majority view (≈ 90 %)**  \n- **Human right framing** – Most respondents view health care as a fundamental right that the state should guarantee, citing moral, societal, and public‑health logic.  \n- **Equity and access** – Supporters emphasize that universal coverage would reduce disparities, prevent medical debt, and ensure that people can seek care without financial barriers.  \n- **Economic and productivity arguments** – Many note that healthier citizens contribute more to the economy, and that preventive care under a national system could lower overall health‑care costs.  \n- **Critique of the private system** – Frequent complaints about high premiums, deductibles, surprise bills, and the profit motive of insurers drive the push for a public alternative.  \n\n**Minority concerns (≈ 10 %)**  \n- **Cost and fiscal burden** – A few respondents worry that a universal plan would raise taxes or be unsustainable.  \n- **Quality and wait times** – Some fear that government‑run care would slow access to specialists or increase wait times, citing experiences in other countries.  \n- **Government inefficiency** – A handful of comments claim the state would waste resources or that private competition is necessary to keep services efficient.  \n- **Scope and eligibility** – A few respondents question whether the plan should cover only essential services, include non‑citizens, or be limited to those truly in need.  \n\n**Common themes across the spectrum**  \n- **“Right vs. privilege” debate** – Whether health insurance should be a universal entitlement or a privilege tied to employment.  \n- **Comparisons to other nations** – Many references to Canada, the UK, and other developed countries that provide universal coverage.  \n- **Personal anecdotes** – Several comments are driven by personal or family experiences with high medical costs, chronic illness, or gaps in coverage.  \n\nIn sum, the community largely supports a government‑funded basic health insurance scheme, viewing it as a moral imperative and a practical solution to high costs and inequity, while a small minority raise cautionary points about fiscal impact, quality, and the role of the state.",
