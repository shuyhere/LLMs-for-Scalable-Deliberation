    "main_points": "The majority of respondents view the current tariff policy as a net detriment to the U.S. economy.  \nApproximately **70–75 %** of the comments emphasize rising consumer prices, higher inflation, and increased costs for businesses—especially small firms and import‑dependent sectors. Many highlight the likelihood of retaliatory tariffs, strained trade relationships, and a general erosion of global competitiveness.  \n\nAround **15 %** of the comments point to potential long‑term gains: protection of certain domestic industries, increased tariff revenue, and the possibility of reshoring jobs. These optimistic views, however, are often tempered by concerns about the speed of implementation and the certainty of sustained benefits.  \n\nA small minority—roughly **5–10 %**—express neutral or mixed feelings, noting that short‑term pain could be offset by future gains, or that the policy’s effects are still uncertain.  \n\nCommon themes across the discussion include:  \n* **Consumer burden** – higher prices for goods and services, especially for everyday staples.  \n* **Small‑business hardship** – many businesses report higher costs or loss of orders.  \n* **Trade friction** – fears of retaliation and diminished U.S. influence in global markets.  \n* **Uncertainty about longevity** – concerns that the tariffs may be reversed or altered by future administrations, reducing their intended impact.  \n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that the tariff policy presently imposes significant economic costs on consumers and businesses, with only a minority seeing clear, immediate benefits.",
