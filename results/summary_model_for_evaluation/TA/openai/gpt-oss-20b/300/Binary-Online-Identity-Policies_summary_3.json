    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Majority stance:**  \n  About **70 %** of the comments oppose a mandatory real‑name registration policy.  \n  The strongest arguments against it focus on privacy erosion, the risk of doxxing, potential for abuse by employers or hostile groups, and the belief that anonymity is essential for free expression and for vulnerable users (e.g., activists, people in abusive relationships, or those discussing stigmatized topics).  \n\n- **Supportive stance:**  \n  Roughly **25 %** favor the requirement.  Their main points are that it would increase accountability, deter cyberbullying, reduce scams and fake accounts, and make it easier to identify perpetrators of harassment or illegal activity.  Some suggest the policy should be platform‑specific, applied to sites where personal identity is central (e.g., professional or business‑oriented networks) and optional elsewhere.  \n\n- **Neutral or mixed views:**  \n  Around **5 %** of respondents expressed a conditional or ambivalent position, acknowledging both potential benefits (e.g., safer communities) and risks (e.g., privacy loss).  A few called for a tiered or verification‑based system rather than a blanket rule.  \n\n**Key Themes**\n\n1. **Privacy vs. Accountability** – The debate centers on whether the benefit of holding users accountable outweighs the loss of personal privacy.  \n2. **Safety Concerns** – Many fear that real‑name registration could expose users to harassment, stalking, or discrimination, especially in sensitive or political contexts.  \n3. **Platform Context** – Some respondents argue that the necessity of real names varies by platform type; professional networks might benefit more than entertainment or hobby sites.  \n4. **Technical Feasibility** – A minority raised concerns about how enforcement would work and the potential for data misuse or breaches.  \n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a deep divide between those prioritizing individual privacy and freedom of expression, and those prioritizing community safety and accountability.",
