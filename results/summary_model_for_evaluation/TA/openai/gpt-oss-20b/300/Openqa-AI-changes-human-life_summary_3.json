    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of AI‑Impact Comments**\n\n- **Productivity & Efficiency (≈70 %)** – Most respondents noted that AI has streamlined routine tasks, accelerated research, and saved time at work or in daily life. Common examples include drafting emails, summarizing long texts, automating coding or design work, and generating ideas for projects or marketing.\n\n- **Information Access & Learning (≈60 %)** – A large share highlighted AI’s role in making knowledge more readily available. Users appreciated quick answers, deeper explanations, and the ability to ask highly specific questions that traditional search engines sometimes miss.\n\n- **Creativity & Content Creation (≈45 %)** – Many spoke of AI helping with art, writing, music, image generation, and brainstorming. The tool was described as a creative partner that expands possibilities.\n\n- **Privacy & Trust Concerns (≈35 %)** – About a third expressed unease about data collection, surveillance, and the difficulty of verifying the authenticity of AI‑generated content. Several comments noted a growing skepticism toward online information and a heightened sense of mistrust.\n\n- **Job Security & Economic Impact (≈30 %)** – A notable minority worried that AI could replace jobs, especially in creative or knowledge‑based fields. Some also mentioned the potential loss of human skill development due to over‑reliance on AI.\n\n- **Mixed or Neutral Views (≈25 %)** – A smaller portion reported minimal impact, preferring to use AI only occasionally. Some acknowledged both benefits (time‑saving) and drawbacks (making them “lazy” or more cautious).\n\n- **Social & Emotional Effects (≈20 %)** – A few respondents mentioned AI’s influence on relationships, mental health support, and the changing nature of social interactions, noting both positive (easier communication) and negative (lack of genuine human connection) outcomes.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nThe prevailing sentiment is that AI generally enhances productivity, learning, and creativity, while a significant minority voice concerns about privacy, trust, and job security. The technology is seen as a powerful assistant, but its broader societal and ethical implications continue to prompt caution among users.",
