    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe discussion reflects a broad spectrum of attitudes toward tipping, with most comments centering on three key concerns: the fairness and necessity of tips, the impact of tipping on wages and worker stability, and the design of the tipping system itself.\n\n1. **Critique of the Current Tipping Model**  \n   A large share of respondents feel that the U.S. tipping culture is over‑extended and often mandatory, even for minimal or no service (e.g., coffee, pickup, self‑service). Many describe the system as a way for employers to underpay staff, shifting the burden of wage adequacy onto customers. The prevalence of electronic prompts and default tip options is seen as coercive, leading to a sense of “tipping addiction” or “forced gratitude.”  \n\n2. **Call for Living or Minimum Wages**  \n   A significant portion argue that tipped workers should receive a livable wage—often cited as at least the federal minimum or a higher “living wage” threshold. The idea is that if employers paid a fair base salary, tipping could become optional or a bonus for exceptional service. This sentiment echoes European models where tipping is largely unnecessary because employers provide sufficient pay.\n\n3. **Proposals for System Reform**  \n   - **Optional or Service‑Based Tipping**: Several respondents propose making tips optional and tying them explicitly to the quality of service, rather than to the transaction itself.  \n   - **Standardized or Flat Rates**: Some suggest a fixed tip amount (e.g., $5 or a flat percentage) or a service charge that is built into the price, reducing the need for individual tip decisions.  \n   - **Separate “Service Charge”**: A few recommend a mandatory 10–15 % service charge for full‑service restaurants while leaving other venues tip‑free.  \n   - **Transparency and Choice**: Others call for clearer distinctions between “tip” and “service charge” on receipts, and for an easy “no‑tip” option in electronic payment systems.\n\n4. **Mixed Support for Tipping**  \n   While many critique or wish to eliminate tipping, a minority view it as a legitimate incentive for good service and a necessary supplement to low base pay. These respondents typically tip around 15–25 % for sit‑down dining and adjust based on service quality, but still advocate for higher wages to reduce the reliance on tips.\n\n5. **Overall Sentiment**  \n   The prevailing sentiment leans toward reforming or phasing out the current tipping practice in favor of a model where employers provide a living wage and tipping, if retained, is a voluntary reward for exceptional service rather than a baseline expectation. The discussion underscores a growing frustration with the pressure placed on consumers and a desire for a fairer, more predictable compensation structure for service workers.",
