    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly express concern that the proposed cuts to federal academic funding will undermine the quality and accessibility of education.  \n* About **80 %** of the remarks criticize the decision, citing risks such as reduced research opportunities, fewer scholarships, larger class sizes, and a loss of competitiveness on the global stage. Many respondents frame the cuts as a deliberate attempt to weaken intellectual capacity, citing fears of authoritarian control, political bias, and a “woke” agenda that would be stifled.  \n* Roughly **15 %** of the comments remain neutral or express uncertainty, noting a need for more detail on what is actually being cut and how it will be reallocated before forming a judgment.  \n* The remaining **5 %** support the policy or see it as a necessary correction of perceived over‑funding, arguing that some universities receive excessive federal support, that cutting wasteful spending could improve efficiency, or that it would encourage more responsible use of public money.\n\nCommon themes across the majority of comments include:  \n* **Impact on students** – fears that lower funding will increase fees, cut financial aid, and make higher education less attainable for low‑income families.  \n* **Research and innovation** – concerns that federal grants drive breakthroughs in medicine, technology, and basic science, and that their reduction will slow progress and encourage a brain‑drain.  \n* **Political motives** – accusations that the cuts are designed to suppress dissenting voices, punish institutions perceived as left‑leaning, and consolidate power rather than serve the public interest.  \n* **Quality of teaching** – worries that budget cuts will force schools to reduce staff, eliminate programs, and compromise curriculum standards.  \n\nIn sum, the prevailing view is that trimming federal academic funding would have widely negative repercussions for education quality, research output, and national competitiveness, while a minority believes it could rectify perceived excesses and improve fiscal stewardship.",
