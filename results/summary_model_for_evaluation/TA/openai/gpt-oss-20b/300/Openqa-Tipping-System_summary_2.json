    "main_points": "Across the comments, a few dominant themes emerge:\n\n* **Perceived over‑reach of the system** – The majority feel that tipping has become compulsory, especially for minor or pre‑served transactions such as coffee, take‑out, or self‑service kiosks. Many describe the experience as “forced” or “expected” and express frustration that the practice has expanded beyond traditional sit‑down dining.\n\n* **Low base wages and reliance on tips** – A strong current runs that tipped workers earn far below a living wage (often cited as around $2 – $3 an hour). Most respondents note that tips are a safety net rather than a bonus, and they argue that employers should pay a fair hourly rate.\n\n* **Calls for reform or elimination** – A large share of participants advocate either abolishing tipping altogether or replacing it with a flat service charge or an “included” fee. Several suggest adopting the European model, where wages cover the full cost and tips are optional or absent.\n\n* **Optional, service‑based tipping** – Many respondents support a system where tipping is genuinely discretionary and tied to the quality of service. Suggestions include fixed amounts, clear percentage guidelines, or a “no‑tip” option on electronic receipts.\n\n* **Fair distribution and transparency** – Concerns about how tips are split among staff, whether tips are taxed, and whether employees actually receive the money they earn recur frequently. A number of comments call for a system that guarantees workers keep their tips.\n\n* **Mixed support for the current practice** – While some participants still see tipping as a valuable incentive for good service, they also stress that the practice should be paired with higher base wages and fewer expectations of a tip for every transaction.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward a desire for a fairer wage structure that would reduce or eliminate the pressure on consumers to tip, while still allowing tipping to serve as a reward for genuinely excellent service.",
