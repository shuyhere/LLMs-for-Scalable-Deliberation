The majority see AI as a productivity booster—helping with research, drafting documents, generating ideas, and automating routine tasks. Many also highlight the convenience of instant information access through voice assistants and chat‑based tools, and the supportive role AI can play in learning, mental well‑being, and creative projects.\n\nAt the same time, a notable minority raise legitimate concerns. Privacy and data security are frequently mentioned, as are worries about job displacement, the spread of misinformation, and the erosion of critical thinking and authenticity. Some respondents fear that the ease of generating content may lead to over‑reliance on AI, reducing human originality. Environmental impact and the ethical use of AI also surface as issues that could outweigh the benefits for some.\n\nIn short, most people feel that AI has positively transformed their efficiency and creativity, while a smaller but significant segment cautions that the technology’s rapid adoption brings privacy, job security, and ethical challenges that must be addressed.",
