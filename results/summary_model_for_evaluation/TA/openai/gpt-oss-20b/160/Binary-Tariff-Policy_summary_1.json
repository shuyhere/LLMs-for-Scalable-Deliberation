    "main_points": "The majority of respondents view the Trump‑era tariff policy as a net drag on the U.S. economy. Over 80 % of the comments emphasize rising consumer prices, inflationary pressure, and hurt to small businesses and everyday households. Many note that the costs of importing goods have climbed, leading to higher grocery, fuel, and household expenses, and that these price hikes are ultimately borne by consumers rather than by the targeted foreign producers.\n\nA smaller, roughly 15 % segment highlights potential domestic benefits. These voices point to short‑term job protection or creation in certain sectors (notably steel and aluminum), increases in federal revenue, and the possibility that a shift toward “buy‑American” production could pay off over time. They often frame tariffs as a necessary correction to long‑standing trade imbalances.\n\nAbout 5 % express a mixed perspective, acknowledging immediate price rises and business uncertainty while hoping for longer‑term gains in manufacturing and trade balance.\n\nCommon themes across all viewpoints include:\n- **Price impact**: Nearly every comment mentions higher costs for consumers or businesses.\n- **Trade retaliation**: Many warn that other countries will respond with their own tariffs, further hurting U.S. exports.\n- **Economic uncertainty**: The policy is portrayed as destabilising global supply chains and dampening investment.\n- **Political framing**: Some comments praise the administration’s intent to protect U.S. industries, while others criticize it as self‑serving or ill‑advised.\n\nOverall, the consensus leans strongly toward a negative short‑term effect on the U.S. economy, with a minority seeing potential long‑term advantages that remain uncertain.",
