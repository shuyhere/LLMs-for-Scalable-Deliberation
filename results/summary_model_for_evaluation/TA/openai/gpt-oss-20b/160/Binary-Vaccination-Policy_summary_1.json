    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nOverall, the discussion shows a strong inclination toward allowing government‑led enforcement of vaccination and quarantine measures during severe epidemics. Roughly **70 %** of the comments endorse some form of mandatory policy, often conditioned on the epidemic’s severity and the proven safety of the vaccine.  \n\n**Key points of agreement**\n\n1. **Public‑health priority** – Most respondents view enforcement as a necessary tool to protect the wider community, curb transmission, and save lives.  \n2. **Conditional mandate** – The majority of supporters specify that the authority should apply only in a “severe” or “critical” epidemic, and that the vaccines must be scientifically validated and, ideally, free of cost.  \n3. **Herd‑immunity logic** – Many cite herd immunity and the historical success of vaccination programs (e.g., polio, measles) as justification for mandates.  \n\n**Key concerns among dissenters**\n\n1. **Individual autonomy** – About **20 %** of the comments oppose mandates on the grounds that the government should not dictate what enters a person’s body.  \n2. **Trust in government** – Several respondents distrust the government’s record on handling epidemics and fear potential abuse or overreach.  \n3. **Safety and side‑effects** – A minority express worries about vaccine‑related risks, especially given the rapid development during COVID‑19.  \n4. **Separation of powers** – Some argue that public‑health policy should be advisory rather than coercive, and that quarantine can be enforced, but vaccination should remain voluntary.  \n\n**Balanced or mixed positions**\n\nApproximately **10 %** of the comments present a nuanced view: they support quarantine enforcement, encourage vaccination, but discourage compulsory vaccination unless the benefits outweigh the risks. These voices emphasize transparency, clear scientific evidence, and safeguards for civil liberties.\n\n**Overall sentiment**\n\nThe discussion leans decisively toward supporting government authority in crisis situations, with a strong emphasis on context (severity, evidence, cost, and ethical safeguards). Opposing views are mainly rooted in individual rights, skepticism of governmental motives, and concerns about vaccine safety. The conversation reflects a common pattern: a willingness to sacrifice some personal freedom for collective health, tempered by a demand for accountability and evidence.",
