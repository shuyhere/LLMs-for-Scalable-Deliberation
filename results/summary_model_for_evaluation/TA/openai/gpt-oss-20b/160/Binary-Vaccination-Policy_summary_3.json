    "main_points": "The comments collectively reveal a clear divide on whether governments should be empowered to enforce vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics.  \n\n**Support for enforcement**  \n- A substantial majority see mandatory measures—especially vaccination—as essential for protecting public health, curbing transmission, and saving lives.  \n- Many respondents qualify this support with conditions such as:  \n  * the epidemic must be truly severe,  \n  * the vaccine must be proven safe and effective,  \n  * enforcement should be temporary and proportional,  \n  * clear communication and transparency from health authorities are required.  \n- Quarantine is almost universally viewed as a legitimate tool, while vaccination is the primary point of contention.  \n\n**Opposition to enforcement**  \n- About a third of comments argue that forcing vaccines violates individual bodily autonomy, raises concerns about side‑effects, or reflects mistrust of government motives.  \n- Some respondents distinguish between voluntary vaccination and compulsory measures, supporting the former while rejecting mandates.  \n- A small subset criticizes both vaccination and quarantine mandates, emphasizing personal freedom and skepticism about government authority.  \n\n**Common themes across the spectrum**  \n- **Evidence‑based decision‑making**: Many emphasize the need for scientific validation and FDA/CDC approval before any mandate.  \n- **Trust and transparency**: Confidence in public‑health agencies strongly influences support; lack of trust fuels opposition.  \n- **Balancing rights and safety**: The tension between collective safety and individual rights is a recurring motif, with most respondents calling for a measured, case‑by‑case approach.  \n\nIn summary, while most participants lean toward allowing government enforcement of vaccination and quarantine during serious epidemics, a significant minority remains opposed, citing autonomy, safety, and mistrust as key concerns. The prevailing sentiment is that any such authority should be exercised cautiously, transparently, and with safeguards to protect civil liberties.",
