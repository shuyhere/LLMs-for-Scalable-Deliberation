    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly paints the academic‑funding cuts as a harmful and shortsighted move.  \n- **Negative concerns dominate** – most respondents stress that reducing money for schools and research will hurt students, limit innovation, weaken the U.S.’s global standing, and widen social and economic gaps.  \n- **Ideological framing is common** – many link the cuts to a perceived left‑leaning bias in universities, to a strategy of keeping the population uneducated, or to a broader “woke” agenda.  \n- **Support for the cuts is a small minority** – a few respondents argue that the money is wasted on elite institutions, that the cuts will curb “liberal indoctrination,” or that they could free up funds for other priorities.  \n- **Neutral or uncertain voices** – a handful of comments express indecision or call for more information before judging the policy.  \n\nOverall, the prevailing view is that cutting academic funding is detrimental to educational quality, research progress, and the nation’s future competitiveness.",
