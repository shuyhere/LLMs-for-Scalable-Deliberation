    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nAcross the comments, a clear pattern emerges concerning the role of government during severe epidemics:\n\n* **Support for enforcement** – Roughly three‑quarters of the comments express that the government should be empowered to enforce vaccination and quarantine measures when an epidemic reaches a serious level.  Many emphasize that such power is justified by the need to protect public health, prevent widespread illness and death, and maintain essential services.  Conditions frequently mentioned include:  \n  * the outbreak must be severe or threatening to national survival,  \n  * vaccines must be proven safe and effective,  \n  * enforcement should be transparent, evidence‑based, and time‑limited.\n\n* **Opposition to mandates** – About a quarter of the comments oppose mandatory vaccination (and sometimes quarantine) on the grounds of bodily autonomy, distrust of government, concerns about vaccine side‑effects, and the belief that individuals should decide what goes into their bodies.  These participants often call for voluntary uptake, incentives, or strictly non‑coercive policies.\n\n* **Middle‑ground positions** – A number of comments advocate a hybrid approach: vaccination should be strongly encouraged or incentivised, but not forced; quarantine is more acceptable, especially if it is proportionate to the risk.  These voices also stress that any government authority should be exercised with safeguards, clear communication, and a focus on public trust.\n\n* **Key themes** –  \n  * **Severity threshold** – Enforcement is widely linked to the seriousness of the outbreak.  \n  * **Evidence and safety** – Supporters demand clear evidence of vaccine efficacy and safety before mandates.  \n  * **Transparency and proportionality** – Even proponents of enforcement call for clear justification, proportional limits, and a planned exit strategy.  \n  * **Individual rights vs. public good** – Opponents frame the debate as a conflict between personal liberty and collective safety, while supporters frame it as a necessary public‑health measure.\n\nOverall, the discussion shows a strong inclination toward government authority in crisis contexts, tempered by concerns about individual rights, the need for scientific certainty, and the importance of maintaining public trust.",
