    "main_points": "**Key take‑aways**\n\n- **Strong push to end or reduce tipping** – A majority of respondents would like the tipping system to disappear, be optional, or replaced by a flat service charge. Many argue that the current model forces consumers to tip, even when no direct service is provided, and that it perpetuates low base wages for service workers.\n\n- **Living wages are the common solution** – Most commenters see the root of the problem as employers paying below‑living wages. They call for a higher minimum wage (often citing a $15/hour target) or a guaranteed livable wage so that tips become a bonus rather than a necessity.\n\n- **Automated tip prompts are disliked** – The prevalence of “tip” options on POS systems and mobile apps is frequently cited as a source of pressure and confusion. Commenters suggest making a “no tip” option obvious, or embedding the tip into the menu price instead of presenting it as a separate choice.\n\n- **Quality‑based tipping still matters** – While many want to eliminate mandatory tips, a sizable portion still supports tipping for good or exceptional service. They advocate for a clearer linkage between service quality and tip amount, and for more flexible, discretionary tipping rather than fixed percentages.\n\n- **European model is often praised** – Several respondents reference European countries that provide sufficient wages and minimal or no tipping. These examples are used to illustrate how a different system can work and to argue that tipping should not be a cultural requirement in the U.S.\n\n- **Mixed feelings about the necessity of tipping** – Some respondents are comfortable with tipping when appropriate, whereas others feel it is unfair to rely on customers to supplement wages. A minority still see tipping as a positive incentive for better service, though they also desire higher base pay.\n\n- **Call for transparency and choice** – Across the board, commenters want clearer information about how much a tip is expected, what it goes toward, and the ability to decide whether and how much to tip without feeling coerced.\n\nOverall, the discussion centers on balancing fair compensation for workers with consumer autonomy, and many see a shift toward livable wages and optional, quality‑based tipping as the most equitable path forward.",
