    "main_points": "**Overall view**\n\n- **Supportive (≈ 75 %)** –  Most respondents feel that the United States should welcome refugees who are escaping war or persecution.  The prevailing arguments highlight humanitarian responsibility, moral duty, and the historical legacy of the U.S. as a haven for those fleeing oppression.  \n- **Conditional support (≈ 15 %)** – A sizable minority agree but insist on strict vetting, limits on numbers, or prioritizing those from countries directly affected by U.S. foreign policy.  These commenters stress the need for security checks, integration plans, and safeguards against potential abuse of the system.  \n- **Opposing (≈ 10 %)** – The smallest group rejects or is very skeptical about expanding refugee intake.  Their main concerns revolve around strain on public resources, national debt, existing domestic poverty, or fears that refugees might compete with citizens for jobs and services.  \n\n**Key themes that cut across the comments**\n\n1. **Humanitarian Imperative** – Many point to the moral obligation to protect people in life‑threatening circumstances and view acceptance as a reflection of American values.  \n2. **Security & Vetting** – A recurring call for thorough background checks and clear definitions of what constitutes a legitimate refugee.  \n3. **Economic & Resource Constraints** – Arguments that the U.S. is already stretched thin, citing debt, healthcare costs, and housing shortages as barriers to additional intake.  \n4. **Domestic Priorities vs. Global Responsibility** – Some stress that the country should first address its own citizens’ needs before extending assistance abroad.  \n5. **Cultural and Social Impact** – Discussions around potential effects on community cohesion, crime rates, and the overall social fabric.  \n\n**Overall sentiment**\n\nThe discussion leans strongly toward acceptance, tempered by pragmatic concerns about security, resources, and limits.  Those most opposed frame their arguments around domestic welfare and fiscal responsibility, whereas the majority see refugee intake as an ethical and historically rooted duty, provided that proper safeguards are in place.",
