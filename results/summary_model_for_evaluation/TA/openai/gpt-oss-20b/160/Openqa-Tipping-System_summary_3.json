    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nAcross the comments, most respondents view the current U.S. tipping system as excessive and want it to be less obligatory.  \n- **≈70 %** express a desire to eliminate or reduce mandatory tipping, citing that tipping has become an expectation in almost every purchase, that it forces consumers to pay extra, and that it allows employers to under‑pay workers.  \n- **≈20 %** defend tipping, arguing that it rewards excellent service and that workers still need it because many receive wages below a livable floor. These respondents generally favor keeping tipping optional but believe that the culture of “mandatory” or “automated” tips should be removed.  \n- **≈10 %** propose systemic changes such as a fixed service charge (e.g., 10 %) or adopting European models where wages are higher and tipping is voluntary.  \n\nCommon themes among those wanting change include:  \n- **Living wages** – a majority see tipping as a way for employers to pay too little.  \n- **Optionality** – many want to tip only when service is provided and not when it is merely a transaction.  \n- **Transparency and choice** – several comments call for clear “no tip” options on payment screens and for tipping to be tied directly to service quality rather than a default percentage.  \n\nA minority of comments (about 5 %) remain neutral or simply note that tipping is part of their personal routine without calling for reform. Overall, the sentiment leans strongly toward making tipping optional, increasing base pay for service workers, and reducing the pressure on consumers to tip for every interaction.",
