    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA strong majority of respondents view universal health coverage as a fundamental right and an essential public good, with roughly 70‑80 % expressing support.  The main arguments for government‑provided basic insurance include:\n\n* **Equity and access** – “Everyone should have health care, not just the wealthy or those with jobs.”  \n* **Human rights** – Healthcare is framed as a basic necessity, not a privilege.  \n* **Financial protection** – Preventing medical debt and bankruptcies is a recurring theme.  \n* **Public health benefits** – Early and preventive care is seen as more cost‑effective for the system as a whole.  \n* **International comparison** – The U.S. is cited as the only major country without universal coverage, and this is portrayed as a national shortcoming.\n\nA smaller minority (about 10‑15 %) opposes full government coverage, citing concerns such as:\n\n* **High fiscal cost** and the potential for increased taxes.  \n* **Reduced quality or longer wait times** in a publicly run system.  \n* **Ideological preference for private choice** and fear of government overreach.  \n* **Concerns about abuse** and inefficiency of a large bureaucratic program.\n\nA few comments are neutral or uncertain, noting that the feasibility or design of the program would determine its merits.\n\nIn sum, the discussion is dominated by a pro‑universal‑care stance driven by principles of fairness, economic protection, and public health, with opposition largely focused on cost, quality, and ideological objections.",
