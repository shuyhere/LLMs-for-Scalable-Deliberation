    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **General sentiment:**  \n  - **Negative**: ~ 70 % of the comments express concern that the tariff policy harms the U.S. economy, citing higher consumer prices, inflation, and damage to small businesses.  \n  - **Mixed**: ~ 25 % note that the policy may hurt the economy in the short run but could offer benefits—such as protecting certain industries or fostering long‑term job creation—in the medium to long term.  \n  - **Positive**: ~ 5 % argue that the tariffs strengthen the U.S. by generating revenue, encouraging domestic production, and countering unfair trade practices.\n\n- **Key themes across the comments:**\n\n  1. **Price and inflation pressure** – A dominant concern is that tariffs are passed on to consumers, driving up the cost of goods and reducing purchasing power.  \n  2. **Small‑business impact** – Many note that entrepreneurs who rely on imports (especially from China) face higher costs or supply‑chain disruptions, threatening their viability.  \n  3. **Trade retaliation and diplomatic strain** – Several comments warn that aggressive tariffs invite retaliatory measures, hurting U.S. exporters and worsening diplomatic relations.  \n  4. **Potential industrial protection** – The positive voices highlight that certain sectors (steel, aluminum, domestic manufacturing) may gain competitive advantage and job opportunities.  \n  5. **Uncertainty and long‑term outlook** – Mixed‑feel comments point to a short‑term economic slowdown but hope for eventual stability or growth once the policy takes effect.\n\n- **Overall tone:**  \n  The prevailing view is that the tariff policy is **negative** for the current economic climate, especially for consumers and small businesses. While a minority see possible long‑term advantages for domestic industry and national revenue, the broader consensus emphasizes the immediate cost burden and risks of trade retaliation.",
