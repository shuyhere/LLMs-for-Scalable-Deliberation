    "main_points": "The overwhelming tone among the comments is negative.  Roughly **90 %** of respondents view the funding cuts as harmful, citing a range of concerns that span from immediate student hardship to long‑term national competitiveness.  Only about **10 %** express support or neutrality, often arguing that the cuts remove waste, curb “woke” influence, or align with broader fiscal priorities.\n\n### Main concerns expressed\n\n| Theme | What people are saying |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| **Student impact** | Cuts threaten access to K‑12 and higher‑education programs, increase financial burdens, and widen social‑mobility gaps. |\n| **Research & innovation** | Many fear that reduced federal grants will halt medical, scientific, and technological breakthroughs, driving talent abroad. |\n| **Economic competitiveness** | Respondents note that education fuels a skilled workforce; without it, the U.S. risks falling behind global peers. |\n| **Political motive** | A sizable fraction believes the cuts are a deliberate effort to suppress independent thinking, limit “woke” agendas, or weaken left‑leaning institutions. |\n| **Fiscal efficiency** | Those in favor argue that the money is misallocated to large endowments or ineffective programs and that savings can be re‑directed elsewhere. |\n\n### Notable viewpoints\n\n* **Criticism of political strategy** – Several comments describe the policy as a tactic to “keep the population ignorant” or to weaken dissenting voices.  \n* **Concerns about national security** – Some link reduced research funding to a loss of strategic advantage.  \n* **Calls for balance** – A smaller subset suggests a middle ground: cut wasteful spending but maintain essential support for education and research.  \n* **Support for cuts** – A minority praise the decision, citing administrative costs, endowment excesses, or ideological alignment with the administration’s priorities.\n\n### Overall impression\n\nThe collective sentiment is that the funding cuts are ill‑timed, potentially short‑sighted, and likely to produce adverse effects on students, researchers, and the broader economy.  While a minority argues for fiscal prudence or ideological purity, the prevailing concern is that the policy will undermine the U.S.’s educational foundation and long‑term innovation capacity.",
