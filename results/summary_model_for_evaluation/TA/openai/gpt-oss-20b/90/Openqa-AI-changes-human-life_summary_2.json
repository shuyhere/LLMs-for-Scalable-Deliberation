Over **70 %** of the responses highlight benefits such as faster research, easier content creation, improved productivity at work or school, and new creative possibilities (e.g., generating artwork or writing assistance).  Many also note that AI helps them stay organized, learn new skills, and manage household tasks more efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, a noticeable minority—about **25 %** of the comments—express worries.  These concerns focus mainly on privacy (the feeling that AI is “tracking” them), job security (automation replacing human roles), and the potential for misinformation or over‑reliance on AI for tasks that normally require critical thinking.  A few participants describe a loss of trust in online information and the anxiety that comes from knowing AI can produce convincing but potentially false content.\n\nA small group (roughly **5 %**) reports little or no impact, noting that they use AI only sparingly or only for simple tasks such as summarizing a paragraph or drafting a thank‑you note.\n\nOverall, the sentiment is predominantly positive, with most users appreciating AI’s capacity to streamline work and enrich creativity, while a significant share of respondents remain cautious about privacy, authenticity, and the long‑term effects on employment and critical thinking.",
