    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance** – The majority of comments favor giving the government the authority to enforce both quarantine and vaccination during severe epidemics, citing public‑health benefits such as herd immunity, faster containment, and protection of vulnerable populations.  \n- **Conditional support** – About one‑fifth of respondents support enforcement but only under specific circumstances: when an epidemic is truly severe, when vaccines are proven safe and effective, or when the measures are temporary and accompanied by adequate oversight.  \n- **Opposition** – Roughly one‑tenth of the comments oppose any mandatory policy, arguing that it infringes on personal bodily autonomy, could lead to abuse of power, or that vaccines have insufficient long‑term safety data.  \n- **Key arguments for enforcement**  \n  - **Collective good**: Governments can prevent widespread illness and death when individual decisions are insufficient.  \n  - **Speed and coverage**: Mandates accelerate immunisation rates and help suppress outbreaks quickly.  \n  - **Protection of the vulnerable**: Mandatory measures safeguard children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.  \n- **Key arguments against enforcement**  \n  - **Individual rights**: Vaccination is a personal medical choice; forcing it violates bodily autonomy.  \n  - **Safety concerns**: Rapid vaccine development may leave gaps in safety or efficacy data, raising legitimate fears of side effects.  \n  - **Trust issues**: Some respondents distrust government motives or worry about precedent for future overreach.  \n- **Mixed views** – Several comments differentiate between quarantine and vaccination, supporting mandatory isolation while preferring voluntary vaccination, or vice versa.  \n- **Contextual nuance** – Many respondents frame their positions in terms of “severe epidemics” (e.g., COVID‑19) rather than routine disease control, indicating that they see enforcement as a crisis‑specific tool rather than a permanent policy.  \n\nOverall, the discussion leans strongly toward allowing government enforcement of quarantine and vaccination when a serious outbreak threatens public health, while a minority insists on preserving individual choice and raising concerns about safety and potential for abuse.",
