    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe comments overwhelmingly view the Trump‑era tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy and society.  \n- **Negative sentiment** dominates, with most respondents citing higher consumer prices, inflation, and a drag on spending as primary concerns.  \n- **Small‑business impact** is a frequent theme; many note that import‑dependent firms are forced to raise costs or shut down.  \n- **Trade retaliation** is highlighted as a key risk, with critics warning that other countries will respond with their own tariffs, further eroding U.S. competitiveness and foreign‑policy influence.  \n- **Mixed or optimistic views** appear in a minority of comments. Some argue that tariffs could eventually strengthen domestic industries, reduce trade deficits, or bring fiscal revenue, and that short‑term pain may be offset by long‑term gains.  \n- **Industry‑specific effects** such as supply‑chain disruptions and the “reshoring” debate are also noted, with some commenters suggesting that the policy fails to motivate U.S. firms to bring production back home.  \n\nIn short, the prevailing assessment is that the tariffs impose immediate costs on consumers and businesses, threaten international trade relationships, and are unlikely to deliver the promised economic benefits. The few who see potential upside emphasize long‑term structural gains that, in their view, could outweigh the current disadvantages.",
