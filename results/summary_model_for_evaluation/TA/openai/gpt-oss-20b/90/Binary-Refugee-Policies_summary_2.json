    "main_points": "**Overall Sentiment**\n\n- Roughly three‑quarters of respondents view the U.S. accepting refugees fleeing war or persecution as a positive, humanitarian act—though most add caveats.  \n- About one‑fifth express concerns that such policy would overburden public services, strain the economy, or create security risks.  \n- The remaining portion feel uncertain or neutral, often balancing empathy for refugees against domestic priorities.\n\n**Key Themes Among Supporters**\n\n1. **Humanitarian Imperative** – Many cite moral duty, the right to safety, and the nation’s immigrant heritage as reasons to welcome refugees.  \n2. **Conditional Acceptance** – A common condition is rigorous vetting and integration measures to mitigate perceived risks.  \n3. **Resource Management** – While supportive, many emphasize that assistance should be proportional to the nation’s capacity and not undermine services for existing citizens.\n\n**Key Themes Among Opponents**\n\n1. **Domestic Priorities** – Concerns that refugees could divert resources away from U.S. citizens facing economic, health, or social challenges.  \n2. **Security and Crime** – Fears of inadequate background checks, potential criminal activity, or overloading law‑enforcement systems.  \n3. **Economic Impact** – Arguments that large refugee inflows could depress wages, increase public spending, or create job competition.\n\n**Neutral or Mixed Positions**\n\n- Several respondents acknowledge the complexity of the issue, noting that while refugees deserve help, the infrastructure and policy framework must be strengthened first.  \n- Some highlight the need for clearer definitions of “refugee” versus “economic migrant” to prevent abuse of the system.\n\n**Overall Takeaway**\n\nThe discussion reflects a strong humanitarian inclination tempered by pragmatic concerns about security, resources, and national priorities. Most voices advocate for a balanced approach: welcoming refugees while implementing thorough vetting, limiting intake to sustainable levels, and ensuring that domestic needs are not neglected.",
