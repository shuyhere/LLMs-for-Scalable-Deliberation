    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance**  \n  Roughly **three‑quarters** of respondents view the United States as having a moral obligation to accept refugees fleeing war or persecution. These participants emphasize humanitarian duty, the country’s immigrant heritage, and the potential benefits of cultural diversity and global leadership.\n\n- **Conditions and caveats**  \n  Most supporters also call for **rigorous vetting** and **clear limits** on numbers, stressing that refugee intake should not unduly strain public services or compromise national security. A sizable minority (about **one‑fifth**) argues that the United States is already overburdened—whether by debt, existing immigration or domestic needs—and therefore should not admit more refugees until internal problems are addressed.  \n\n- **Opposition**  \n  Those opposed focus on resource allocation, potential increases in crime, and the perception that the U.S. is already receiving too many migrants. Some critics also note that U.S. foreign policy often contributes to the very crises that produce refugees, suggesting a need for accountability before extending help.\n\n- **Neutral / mixed views**  \n  A small group remains ambivalent, acknowledging the moral imperative yet expressing uncertainty about practical implementation or the timing of increased intake.\n\n- **Common themes**  \n  1. **Humanitarian responsibility** – many cite the U.S. as a refuge for those escaping violence.  \n  2. **National capacity and safety** – concerns about resources, debt, and background checks.  \n  3. **Historical and moral context** – references to U.S. immigration history, foreign policy, and the nation’s foundational values.  \n  4. **Practical logistics** – suggestions for regional distribution, integration programs, and cooperation with allies.\n\nIn short, the majority support refugee admission under prudent conditions, while a notable minority cautions against expanding intake without addressing domestic pressures and ensuring robust safeguards.",
