    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance**  \n  A large majority of respondents expressed **opposition** to a mandatory real‑name requirement, while a smaller but still significant group voiced **support**. A minority remained neutral or expressed mixed feelings.\n\n- **Key concerns driving opposition**  \n  1. **Privacy and data security** – many fear that requiring real identities would expose users to doxxing, hacking, and unauthorized data sharing.  \n  2. **Freedom of expression** – anonymity is seen as essential for open dialogue, especially for marginalized or politically sensitive voices.  \n  3. **Safety for vulnerable users** – domestic‑abuse survivors, activists, and others worry that forced identification could put them at risk.  \n  4. **Effectiveness doubts** – skeptics question whether real‑name rules would truly curb abuse, noting that users can still create pseudonymous accounts.\n\n- **Key arguments supporting the requirement**  \n  1. **Accountability and reduced abuse** – supporters claim that real names would deter cyber‑bullying, harassment, and misinformation.  \n  2. **Authenticity and trust** – a verified identity is viewed as a way to distinguish genuine users from bots or imposters.  \n  3. **Legal and safety benefits** – some argue that real names can aid law‑enforcement and protect minors and vulnerable populations.\n\n- **Mixed or conditional positions**  \n  A number of respondents suggested a **hybrid approach**: allowing optional real‑name registration, limiting public visibility, or requiring verification only for certain activities. Others called for safeguards such as strong data protection, limited data retention, and clear enforcement mechanisms.\n\n- **Common themes across comments**  \n  - **Balancing safety with privacy** – many emphasized the need to protect users from abuse while preserving the right to remain anonymous.  \n  - **Trust in platforms and governments** – skepticism about how data will be stored, used, or potentially misused.  \n  - **Practicality and enforcement** – doubts about whether a real‑name rule could be effectively implemented or would simply be circumvented.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a tension between the desire for a safer, more accountable online environment and the protection of individual privacy, free expression, and safety for those who rely on anonymity.",
