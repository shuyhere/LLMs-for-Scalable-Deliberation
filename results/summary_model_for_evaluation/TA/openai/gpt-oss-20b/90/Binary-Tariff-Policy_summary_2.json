    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly focuses on the negative consequences of the current tariff policy.  Most respondents argue that tariffs raise consumer prices, hurt small businesses, and strain international trade relations.  They note that the cost burden is ultimately passed to ordinary Americans, potentially slowing economic growth and exacerbating inflation.  Concerns about retaliation, disruption of supply chains, and the weakening of the U.S. position in global markets recur throughout the comments.\n\nA small minority see possible benefits.  Some view tariffs as a tool to protect domestic industries, encourage reshoring, or generate revenue for the Treasury.  These participants tend to emphasize long‑term gains and the potential to correct perceived trade imbalances, although they often acknowledge short‑term pain.\n\nA handful of comments describe a mixed picture, pointing out that while certain sectors may gain, the overall effect on the economy and society is uncertain or negative.  These respondents highlight the trade‑off between protecting specific jobs and the broader cost to consumers.\n\nIn summary, the prevailing sentiment is that the tariff policy is detrimental to the U.S. economy and society, with a minority believing it could bring some long‑term advantages.",
