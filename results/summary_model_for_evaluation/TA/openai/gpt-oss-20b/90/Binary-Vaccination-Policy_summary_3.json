    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance** – The majority of comments favor government‑led enforcement of vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics, with roughly **70 %** expressing direct support.  \n- **Opposition** – About **20 %** of responses argue that such mandates violate individual rights, are unsafe, or are politically motivated.  \n- **Conditional support** – Around **10 %** advocate enforcement only under specific circumstances (e.g., when an outbreak is classified as severe, when vaccines have proven safety and efficacy, or when the public health benefit outweighs the infringement on liberty).\n\n**Key themes**\n\n| Theme | What people say | Approx. share |\n|-------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Public‑health necessity** | “Vaccines and quarantine prevent spread, save lives, and protect the vulnerable.” | 50 % |\n| **Individual autonomy** | “People should decide what goes into their bodies; mandates are coercive.” | 15 % |\n| **Safety and evidence concerns** | “Vaccines were rushed; side‑effects and lack of long‑term data make mandates risky.” | 10 % |\n| **Trust in government** | “Government overreach, past mistakes, or political motives.” | 10 % |\n| **Severity‑based approach** | “Mandates only when an epidemic is truly severe and vaccines are proven.” | 15 % |\n\n**Common concerns**\n\n- **Balancing liberty and safety** – Many voice that the state should intervene only when the public‑health risk is high enough to justify limiting personal choice.  \n- **Evidence and testing** – A recurring point is that vaccines should be fully vetted and proven safe before being mandated.  \n- **Potential for abuse** – A minority warn that once the power to enforce is granted, it could expand to other areas of personal freedom.  \n\n**General sentiment**\n\n- Most respondents view vaccination and quarantine as tools that, when applied appropriately, protect community health.  \n- Opposition hinges largely on the principle of bodily autonomy and skepticism about government motives or vaccine safety.  \n- Conditional supporters outline a pragmatic framework: enforce only when the crisis is severe, the intervention is evidence‑based, and the policy is transparent and time‑limited.",
