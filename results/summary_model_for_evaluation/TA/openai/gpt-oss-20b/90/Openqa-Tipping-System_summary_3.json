    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA substantial majority of respondents believe the current tipping model is unsustainable and unfair. Roughly **70 %** feel that tipping should be eliminated or made optional, arguing that it places an undue burden on consumers and masks inadequate wages for service workers. Among those advocating change, a strong consensus—about **80 %** of the “no‑tipping” camp—calls for a guaranteed living wage for all food‑service employees, citing the low base pay that forces workers to depend on tips for survival.\n\nConversely, a smaller group—around **25 %**—supports the existing system, viewing tipping as a legitimate incentive for high‑quality service. These respondents emphasize that tips should remain voluntary and tied to the level of service received, and they often propose reforms such as fixed‑amount tips or clearer “no‑tip” options rather than outright abolition.\n\nA recurring theme across the comments is the frustration with the prevalence of automated tip prompts on point‑of‑sale devices, which many feel pressure customers into tipping even for minimal or non‑personal service. Suggestions for improvement frequently involve making tipping visible only when genuine service is rendered, offering clear opt‑out options, or incorporating a modest service charge into the bill to replace the tip. Overall, the discussion reflects a tension between preserving a customer‑driven reward system and addressing systemic wage inequities in the service industry.",
