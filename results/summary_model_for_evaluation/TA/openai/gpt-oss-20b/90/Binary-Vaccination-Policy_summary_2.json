    "main_points": "The comments reveal a clear divide on whether the government should be empowered to enforce vaccinations and quarantine during severe epidemics.  \n\n**Supporters (≈ ¾ of the responses)**  \n- Argue that mandatory measures are the most effective way to protect public health, achieve herd immunity, and prevent widespread illness and death.  \n- Cite the COVID‑19 experience as evidence that voluntary compliance was insufficient for many.  \n- Emphasize the duty to safeguard vulnerable groups (children, the elderly, the immunocompromised).  \n- Many add caveats: the authority should only be exercised during a genuine crisis, the vaccines must be proven safe and effective, and the measures should be temporary, proportionate, and accompanied by clear communication.  \n- Some suggest enforcement should be combined with incentives or equal access to avoid creating wealth‑based disparities.\n\n**Opponents (≈ ¼ of the responses)**  \n- Stress individual bodily autonomy and the right to refuse medical interventions.  \n- Express distrust of government motives and fear of overreach or abuse of power.  \n- Highlight concerns about vaccine safety, especially when vaccines are rolled out quickly, and about potential side‑effects or long‑term harm.  \n- Argue that compulsory mandates could erode public trust and fuel resistance, thereby undermining public‑health goals.  \n- A few point to constitutional limits, noting that the U.S. government lacks any such blanket authority.\n\n**Nuanced positions**  \n- Several respondents support quarantine enforcement but reject mandatory vaccination, or vice‑versa.  \n- Others call for a balanced approach that encourages vaccination through education and accessibility while reserving enforcement for the most severe outbreaks.  \n- Some note that the government’s role should be limited to ensuring vaccine safety and efficacy (e.g., FDA approval) rather than mandating uptake.\n\nIn sum, the dominant view favors government enforcement of vaccination and quarantine when an epidemic is severe, but a significant minority insists on preserving individual choice and cautions against the risks of coercion and potential side‑effects.",
