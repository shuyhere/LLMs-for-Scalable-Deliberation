    "main_points": "**Key take‑aways from the discussion**\n\n- **Over‑tipping and forced prompts** – A large share of respondents (≈ 60 %) feel that the current system forces customers to tip, especially with the prevalence of automatic tip prompts on tablets and receipts. They argue this creates an uncomfortable “mandatory” feel that should be eliminated.\n\n- **Living‑wage solution** – Nearly the same proportion (≈ 55 %) believes that the root problem is low base pay for service workers. They call for employers to raise wages to a livable level (often cited as $15 per hour or higher), which would make tipping optional or unnecessary.\n\n- **Optional, service‑based tipping** – About 30 % support keeping tipping but only when it reflects genuine service quality. They favor clear differentiation between full‑service restaurants, drive‑throughs, or counter‑service and would like the option to tip only in those cases.\n\n- **Fixed or simplified tip amounts** – A smaller minority (≈ 10 %) proposes moving away from percentage‑based suggestions to fixed, round amounts (e.g., $20‑$30), arguing that the current system under‑tips and is confusing.\n\n- **Positive views on tipping** – Roughly 20 % still see tipping as a valuable incentive for excellent service and are comfortable leaving generous tips when warranted. They are generally open to adjusting the suggested percentages but do not want to abolish the practice outright.\n\n- **Systemic change over individual choice** – Across the board, many respondents emphasize that the tipping culture is a symptom of broader wage‑setting practices. They think the solution lies in changing how employers compensate workers, rather than simply adjusting customer behavior.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nThe consensus leans toward removing or heavily moderating the automatic tipping prompts, ensuring service workers receive a livable wage, and keeping tipping optional and tied to genuine service quality. Fixed‑amount suggestions and a clear distinction between service types are seen as potential ways to reduce the pressure felt by customers.",
