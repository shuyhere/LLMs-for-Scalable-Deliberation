    "main_points": "**Summary of the discussion**\n\n- **Core critique of the current system** – Most participants view the U.S. tipping culture as over‑extended and inequitable.  \n  - A large share (≈ 70 %) feel that tips are forced or expected in situations where no personal service is provided (e.g., pickup orders, coffee counters, or fast‑food points of sale).  \n  - Many argue that the system is a convenient cover for employers who underpay workers, and that it places an unfair burden on consumers to subsidise wages.\n\n- **Living‑wage solution** – Over half (≈ 55 %) recommend that businesses raise base salaries to a living wage so that tips become optional or unnecessary.  \n  - Some suggest a national or industry‑specific minimum (e.g., $15 / hour) or a flat service charge that automatically covers staff compensation.\n\n- **Optional vs. mandatory tipping** – About a third (≈ 30 %) advocate for tipping to be strictly optional, with clear “no‑tip” options on payment screens.  \n  - A smaller group (≈ 10 %) proposes a mandatory service fee (10 %–15 %) that replaces the tip, arguing it would simplify transactions and eliminate pressure on patrons.\n\n- **Quality‑based tipping** – Several respondents (≈ 25 %) believe tips should reflect the level of service rather than a fixed percentage.  \n  - Suggestions include fixed dollar amounts for standard service, or a system that only asks for a tip when the customer indicates satisfaction.\n\n- **European model reference** – A noticeable minority (≈ 15 %) favour adopting the European approach, where service charges are built into the price and tipping is largely optional.\n\n- **Supporters of the status quo** – A small but vocal group (≈ 10 %) maintains that tipping is a legitimate incentive for workers to provide excellent service and that it should remain optional but encouraged.\n\n- **General sentiment** – The overall tone leans toward reforming or abolishing the current tipping practice in favor of fairer wages and clearer, less intrusive payment options.",
