    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the current tariff policy as a net drag on the U.S. economy and society.  \n* **Negative sentiment** dominates, with roughly 70 % of respondents citing higher consumer prices, hurt small businesses, reduced international trade, and a slowdown in economic growth.  \n* A smaller portion—about 20 %—expresses confidence that the tariffs will ultimately benefit the U.S. by raising revenue, protecting domestic industries, and encouraging reshoring.  \n* The remaining 10 % describe a mixed or uncertain picture, noting that short‑term pain may be offset by longer‑term gains or that the effects will vary across sectors.  \n\nCommon themes among the negative replies include:  \n* **Price increases** for consumers and higher costs for companies that rely on imported goods.  \n* **Retaliation** from trade partners, worsening the trade deficit and damaging U.S. competitiveness.  \n* **Impact on small businesses** and the logistics sector, with reduced orders and job losses.  \n* **Social consequences**, such as decreased purchasing power and potential exacerbation of inequality.  \n\nPositive or optimistic views tend to focus on:  \n* **Revenue gains** for the Treasury and potential job creation in domestic manufacturing.  \n* **Long‑term strategic benefits** by reshoring production and reducing dependency on foreign supply chains.  \n\nOverall, the prevailing assessment is that the tariffs impose immediate costs on consumers and businesses, with uncertain or limited upside for the broader economy.",
