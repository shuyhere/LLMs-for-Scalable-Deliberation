    "main_points": "The discussion shows that internet influencers are widely seen as a legitimate, modern form of work that offers real income, creative freedom, and a platform for ordinary people to reach large audiences. Many respondents highlight the democratizing power of the medium, the opportunities it creates for entrepreneurship, and the way it fills gaps left by traditional media and education.\n\nAt the same time, a substantial share of comments point to significant drawbacks. Authenticity and transparency are common worries, with many noting that sponsorships and self‑promotion can blur the line between genuine advice and paid marketing. The ease of entry and the rapid pace of trend‑driven content are cited as risks for both creators and consumers, especially younger audiences who may overvalue “easy money” over formal education or long‑term career planning. Concerns also include the potential for misinformation, the mental‑health toll on creators, and the broader cultural impact of a media landscape that rewards personality over substance.\n\nA minority of respondents are largely indifferent or skeptical, questioning whether influencer work can truly replace more traditional careers or whether it is sustainable beyond a niche circle of highly successful figures.\n\nOverall, the conversation reflects a nuanced view: influencers are celebrated for expanding creative and economic possibilities, yet many caution that responsibility, regulation, and critical media literacy are essential to ensure that this emergent profession benefits society rather than undermining it.",
