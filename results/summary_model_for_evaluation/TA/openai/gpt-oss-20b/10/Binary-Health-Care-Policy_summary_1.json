Respondents emphasize that health insurance is a right, not a luxury, and that universal coverage would improve access, reduce costs, and protect workers and national security. Many draw comparisons with other countries that already offer comprehensive care, arguing that the U.S. is lagging both in affordability and outcomes. A recurring point is that without government involvement, people—especially the unemployed or low‑income—cannot afford care and may die from preventable conditions. While most are in favor of universal coverage, a few note that such a system should still allow individual choice. Overall, the discussion centers on the moral, economic, and practical imperatives for a government‑led healthcare system.",
