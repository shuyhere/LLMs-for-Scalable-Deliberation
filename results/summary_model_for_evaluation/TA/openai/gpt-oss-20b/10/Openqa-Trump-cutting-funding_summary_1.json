    "main_points": "Most participants view the proposed cuts to academic funding as a serious threat to the nation’s future.  \n- **Negative sentiment** dominates, with roughly **80 %** of the comments expressing concern that reduced funding will weaken schools, limit student opportunities, erode research output, and ultimately diminish the country’s competitiveness.  \n- A small **10 %** of the responses are more mixed: they acknowledge possible justifications for cuts but worry that such reductions could stifle independent thought and long‑term innovation.  \n- The remaining **10 %** indicate uncertainty, noting they lack sufficient information to form an opinion or are awaiting further details before deciding.  \n\nOverall, the discussion highlights a strong belief in education as a foundational pillar for economic growth, innovation, and social equity, coupled with apprehension that trimming resources now could set the nation on a path toward decline.",
