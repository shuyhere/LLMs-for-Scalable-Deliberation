    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **General sentiment**: A majority view the U.S. accepting refugees as a positive, humanitarian act.  \n- **Supportive comments (≈70 %)** emphasize that refugees are fleeing violence and deserve safety and opportunity. Many also stress the importance of careful vetting and integration training to help newcomers adapt.  \n- **Conditional support**: Several participants note that acceptance should be paired with thorough screening, clear rules for integration, and measures that protect existing citizens’ quality of life.  \n- **Opposing comments (≈30 %)** focus on fiscal and social strain, arguing that the country’s resources are already stretched and that refugees could exacerbate debt or compete for limited services.  \n- **Common themes across all views**:  \n  - **Humanitarian concern** for those escaping war or persecution.  \n  - **Resource capacity**: Whether the U.S. can afford to absorb newcomers without compromising its own welfare.  \n  - **Integration & safety**: Calls for robust vetting and education to facilitate smooth assimilation.  \n\nThese perspectives collectively highlight a balance between compassion for displaced individuals and caution over the potential economic and societal impacts of expanding refugee intake.",
