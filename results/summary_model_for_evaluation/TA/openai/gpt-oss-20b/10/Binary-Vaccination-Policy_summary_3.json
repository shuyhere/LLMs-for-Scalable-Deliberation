    "main_points": "The discussion shows a clear majority favoring the enforcement of vaccination and related public‑health measures. About 70 % of the comments argue that mandates are essential for safeguarding community health, preventing disease spread, and protecting vulnerable populations—especially given the experiences of the recent pandemic. Many emphasize that early enforcement was justified when knowledge about the virus was limited and that lifting restrictions should be considered only as evidence grows.\n\nConversely, roughly 30 % express opposition, citing concerns that the vaccines were not sufficiently studied, potential autoimmune side effects, and the importance of individual choice. These viewpoints stress that mandates may overstep personal autonomy and that the risks of the vaccines were not fully understood at the outset. Overall, the conversation leans strongly toward support for mandates, tempered by a minority warning about safety and freedom issues.",
