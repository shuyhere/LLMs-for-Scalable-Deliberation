    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Predominant Concern (55 %)** – Most respondents view the tariff policy as a net detriment. They cite rising prices, inflation, higher costs for consumers, negative impacts on small businesses, and a worsening relationship with China.  \n- **Optimistic View (45 %)** – A smaller but significant group believes the tariffs will strengthen the U.S. economy. They point to increased tariff revenue, a potential stabilizing effect on the budget, and a long‑term strategy for lifting domestic workers out of poverty.  \n- **Balanced Observations** – A few comments note that the policy’s effects may vary over time, with some seeing no current price increases or trade restrictions yet, and others suggesting that the benefits could materialize only if the tariff regime becomes the new normal.  \n\nThe discussion highlights a clear split: while many fear immediate economic harm, others emphasize potential fiscal and long‑term advantages for the United States.",
