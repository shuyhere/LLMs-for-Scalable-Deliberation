Many respondents note that AI tools—especially ChatGPT—have made gathering information faster and more accurate, and some even find them entertaining or helpful in personal conflict‑resolution.  \n\nA minority of comments suggest that the impact is more modest; they view AI as an optional aid rather than a life‑changing tool. These users also highlight concerns about accuracy, the need for fact‑checking, and potential bias in the sources provided.  \n\nIn short, while most participants feel AI has improved efficiency and learning, a smaller share remain cautious about its reliability and overall influence on their daily lives.",
