Many respondents note that influencers can shape trends, connect with audiences in ways traditional media cannot, and even serve as a modern source of news. They also value the authenticity and personal touch that many influencers bring to their content.  \n\n- **Negative perceptions (≈ 20 %)** focus on a lack of authenticity and the annoyance of being “foolishly” influenced. These comments highlight concerns about the commercial nature of influencer work and the potential for trend‑driven homogeneity.  \n\nIn short, most participants see influencers as a valuable, evolving profession that expands media access and opportunities, while a minority caution against its possible superficiality and commercial pressures.",
