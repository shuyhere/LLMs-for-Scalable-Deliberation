    "main_points": "The comments reflect a strong push to rethink or reduce the current tipping model.  \n- **Elimination or minimization of mandatory tipping:** Most voices argue that tipping should not be required, citing pressure on customers and the prevalence of “mandatory” tip prompts in everyday transactions.  \n- **Livable wages for workers:** A recurring theme is that tipped employees should receive a reliable, livable base wage, which would reduce dependence on tips and curb the current wage gap.  \n- **Optional or service‑based tipping:** Those still supportive of tipping want it to be genuinely optional, tied clearly to the quality of service, and not implied by the menu or payment interface.  \n- **Alternatives to the percent‑based system:** Some suggest moving from a percentage model to fixed amounts or a standardized tip (e.g., a set $20 or $30 for certain services) to simplify the process and encourage fairer contributions.  \n- **Enhancing the tipping experience:** A few participants propose small gestures to accompany tips—such as a thank‑you note or a coupon for a future visit—to give the tip a tangible value.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans toward removing the current obligatory tipping structure, ensuring workers earn living wages, and making tipping optional and more transparent when it remains in place.",
