    "main_points": "The comments are largely divided between concerns that the tariff will hurt the economy and expectations that it will help it.  \n- **Negative view (about 56 %)**:  Many participants argue that tariffs raise prices, fuel inflation, damage small businesses, worsen trade ties—especially with China—and do not create enough jobs to offset the costs.  \n- **Positive view (about 44 %)**:  Others see tariffs as a way to reduce U.S. debt to foreign countries, stabilize the economy, bring in revenue that can support the budget, and help lift people out of poverty.  \n\nCommon threads include worries about consumer costs and inflation, debates over the broader impact on the U.S. economy, and differing opinions on whether the policy benefits the average citizen or mainly the wealthy. Overall, the discussion reflects a split between those who view tariffs as a necessary economic corrective and those who see them as an unnecessary burden.",
