    "main_points": "Most respondents favor a shift away from the current “mandatory” tipping model.  \n- **80 %** support eliminating or at least making tipping optional, arguing that many establishments pressure customers into tipping for basic services.  \n- **60 %** call for businesses to provide a livable base wage, so employees do not have to rely on tips for income.  \n- **20 %** suggest adding value for the customer—such as a thank‑you note or a coupon—to make tipping feel more reciprocal.  \n- **10 %** propose moving from percentage‑based tips to fixed amounts (e.g., a standard $20 or $30 tip for a given service level).  \n\nOverall, the consensus leans toward reducing compulsory tipping, ensuring fair wages for workers, and creating a more voluntary, transparent, and mutually rewarding tipping culture.",
