Many respondents see it as a convenient tool that turns routine or “meaningless” work into quick, accurate summaries, and they appreciate its ability to help them learn new subjects faster than traditional methods. A smaller portion of the feedback raises concerns about the reliability of the information produced—highlighting occasional inaccuracies, a need for fact‑checking, and a tendency toward biased source selection. One comment notes a personal benefit in conflict‑resolution, using AI to assess emotional reactions. Overall, the discussion reflects a strong inclination toward valuing AI’s efficiency gains while acknowledging that it remains an optional supplement that requires human judgment for critical accuracy.",
