    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe comments overwhelmingly express concern that cutting academic funding will harm students, educators, and the nation’s long‑term competitiveness.  \n- **Majority view (≈90 %)**: Education is essential for a healthy society; reducing funds threatens innovation, research breakthroughs, and the ability of young people to advance. The cuts are seen as short‑sighted, politically motivated, or detrimental to the country’s future.  \n- **Minority view (≈10 %)**: Some respondents said they lack enough information to form an opinion or saw potential justification for a modest reduction, but still worried about the impact on independent thinking.\n\nKey points raised include:\n- The foundational role of education for all professions and the risk of societal failure if funding falls.  \n- The importance of research for medical and technological progress that can save lives and money.  \n- Concerns that students—especially those who can’t afford college—will suffer.  \n- Fear that reduced funding will weaken the U.S. against competitors in science, industry, and non‑STEM fields.  \n- The need for alternative solutions before cuts are made, as the current proposals risk a gradual decline in quality.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a strong consensus that academic funding is vital, with a small segment uncertain or acknowledging potential political motives but still wary of the consequences.",
