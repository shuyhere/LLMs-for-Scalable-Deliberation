Around 20 % of participants voiced concerns about authenticity or expressed annoyance, noting that many feel influencers lack genuineness or that the space can become overly commercial. The remaining 20 % offered more neutral observations, comparing influencers to older celebrity models or simply acknowledging their presence without a strong stance. Overall, the conversation portrays influencers as a legitimate and influential part of modern media, while also raising questions about authenticity and the potential loss of originality.",
