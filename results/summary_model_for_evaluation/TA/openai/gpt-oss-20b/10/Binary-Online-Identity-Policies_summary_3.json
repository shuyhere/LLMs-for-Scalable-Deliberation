    "main_points": "The discussion is dominated by concerns about privacy, anonymity, and potential misuse of personal data.  \n- **Strong opposition**: About **60 %** of the comments argue against mandatory real‑name registration, citing fears of government or corporate tracking, political persecution, or loss of job security.  \n- **Strong support**: Roughly **20 %** back the idea, believing that real‑name policies would increase accountability, curb cyberbullying, and lead to better online behavior.  \n- **Conditional or mixed views**: The remaining **20 %** either qualify their support—stating it depends on whether a platform or the government enforces it—or acknowledge benefits while warning that it could erode the freedom to speak anonymously.\n\nOverall, the group leans toward preserving anonymity and is wary of imposing real‑name requirements, while a smaller segment sees potential gains in accountability and safety.",
