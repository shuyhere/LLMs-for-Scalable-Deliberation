    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation comments**\n\n- **Dominant concern:** A large share of respondents express that requiring real‑name registration would erode privacy, expose users to potential abuse, and create a database that could be used for surveillance or retaliation.  \n- **Professional and political risk:** Several participants note that revealing identities could lead to discrimination or job loss, especially for those with left‑leaning views or unpopular opinions.  \n- **Fear of misuse:** There is a recurring worry that companies or governments might misuse personal data, sell it, or use it as justification for arrests.  \n- **Accountability arguments:** A minority see the advantage of increased accountability, claiming that real names could reduce cyberbullying and scams.  \n- **Conditional support:** Some respondents are open to the idea only if the enforcement comes from the platform itself rather than from external authorities.  \n- **Balance between anonymity and responsibility:** A few comments recognize both sides, noting that while accountability is valuable, the ability to speak anonymously remains an important freedom.\n\n**Overall impression**\n\n- Roughly **60 %** of the comments voice opposition or caution, citing privacy, safety, and freedom concerns.  \n- Approximately **30 %** highlight potential benefits or are supportive, pointing to accountability and reduced misconduct.  \n- Around **10 %** offer a conditional stance or a balanced view, acknowledging both benefits and risks.  \n\nThe discussion leans toward skepticism about mandatory real‑name registration, with privacy and freedom concerns outweighing the perceived benefits of greater accountability.",
