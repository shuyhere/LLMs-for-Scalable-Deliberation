A majority report that it has made their work faster, helped them learn new skills, and saved time on routine or complex jobs.  A sizable portion also highlights the convenience of instant answers, better organization, and expanded creative possibilities—especially in writing, design, and educational support.\n\nAt the same time, a noticeable share of respondents voice concerns.  Privacy and data‑collection fears recur, as do worries about job displacement and the erosion of critical thinking when people rely too heavily on AI for research or writing.  Some express anxiety over originality, authenticity, and the potential for AI‑generated misinformation, particularly in social media and academic settings.  A smaller group notes that AI has not yet impacted their lives meaningfully, often because they use it sparingly or have not yet discovered useful applications.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans toward the benefits outweighing the drawbacks, but many users remain cautious, balancing the efficiency gains with a desire to maintain personal agency, privacy, and professional relevance.",
