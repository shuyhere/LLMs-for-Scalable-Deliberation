    "main_points": "The comments paint a clear picture of widespread discomfort with the current tipping culture.  \n- **Majority sentiment (≈ 70 %)** leans toward eliminating or making tipping optional. Participants repeatedly describe tipping as “forced,” “over‑expected,” or “a way for employers to underpay.” Many call for a system that respects the customer’s choice and removes the automatic prompt for a tip on every transaction.  \n- **Strong support for a living‑wage solution (≈ 50 %)** appears across the board. Respondents argue that if servers and other service workers received a fair base salary—often citing European models—tipping would become a voluntary act of appreciation rather than a necessity.  \n- **A sizable minority (≈ 20 %)** favor structural changes that keep tipping in place but curb its intensity. These suggestions include:  \n  - Replacing the tipping menu with a flat service charge (10 % or a fixed amount) that is always added to the bill.  \n  - Limiting tips to situations where actual service is rendered (e.g., full‑service restaurants, not take‑out or coffee shop purchases).  \n  - Introducing a “no‑tip” option on POS screens and encouraging fixed tip amounts (e.g., $20 or $30) instead of percentages.  \n- **A smaller fraction (≈ 10 %)** still see value in tipping for exceptional service, but they insist it should be genuinely discretionary and not tied to a company’s wage policy. These voices also note that tipping should not be applied to basic or non‑personal services (e.g., picking up a pizza or hand‑serving a drink).  \n- **Additional concerns** focus on the emotional burden of tipping—customers feeling pressured to tip beyond their means, workers feeling dependent on unpredictable income, and the use of tipping as a “scam” that masks inadequate wages.\n\nOverall, the dialogue favors a shift toward fair, predictable compensation for service workers, with tipping reserved for genuine acts of gratitude. The consensus stresses that tipping should not be an automatic, expected part of every purchase and that businesses should take responsibility for paying staff a livable wage.",
