    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the current tariff policy as a net drag on the U.S. economy. About **70 %** express a negative outlook, citing higher consumer prices, increased inflation, harm to small businesses, strained trade relations, and a risk of recession. A smaller group—roughly **15 %**—frames the tariffs as a positive tool, arguing that they will bring in revenue, protect domestic industries, and eventually support job creation and a stronger trade balance. The remaining **15 %** describe the impact as mixed or uncertain, noting that short‑term costs may be offset by longer‑term benefits such as reshoring or improved fiscal health. Overall, the prevailing sentiment is that the tariffs are causing immediate economic pain and are unlikely to deliver the promised gains in the near term.",
