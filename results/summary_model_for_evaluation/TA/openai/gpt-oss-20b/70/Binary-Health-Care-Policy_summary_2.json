    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly leans toward supporting government‑provided basic health insurance for all citizens. Roughly 80 % of the comments express approval, citing health care as a fundamental right, a means of protecting public health, and a way to reduce medical debt and prevent people from choosing between essentials and treatment.  \n\nA sizable minority—about 15 %—express reservations. Their concerns focus on the potential for high fiscal costs, the risk of reducing quality or choice in the private market, and worries that a universal system might lead to longer wait times or inefficiencies. A smaller group (≈5 %) outright opposes government involvement, arguing that the private sector should remain responsible for health coverage or that the government’s role in health care should be limited.\n\nOverall, the consensus is that expanding access to basic health insurance is desirable and necessary, while the debate centers mainly on how best to balance affordability, quality, and fiscal responsibility.",
