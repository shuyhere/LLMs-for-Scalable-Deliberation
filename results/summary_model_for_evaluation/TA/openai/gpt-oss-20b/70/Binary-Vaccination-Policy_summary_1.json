    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **General stance**: The majority of comments favor giving the government the power to enforce vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics, arguing that such measures protect public health, prevent widespread illness, and save lives.  \n- **Conditional support**: A significant portion of respondents condition their approval on specific safeguards—such as the seriousness of the outbreak, proven safety and efficacy of vaccines, government oversight, and the provision of free or subsidized shots.  \n- **Opposition**: A minority strongly objects to any government mandate, citing individual bodily autonomy, distrust of authorities, concerns about vaccine safety and long‑term side effects, and fears of authoritarian overreach.  \n- **Mixed or nuanced views**: Some commenters separate the two measures, approving quarantine while rejecting compulsory vaccination, or supporting enforcement only when an epidemic is genuinely life‑threatening.  \n- **Key concerns raised**:  \n  - **Safety and testing**: Fear that vaccines may be rushed, inadequately tested, or cause serious adverse reactions.  \n  - **Rights and freedom**: Emphasis on personal choice, the right to refuse medical interventions, and worries that mandates could set a precedent for future governmental power.  \n  - **Trust in the government**: Distrust stemming from past missteps, perceived political motives, or lack of transparency.  \n  - **Equity**: Some highlight that enforcement could disproportionately impact those who cannot afford vaccines or who face barriers to access.  \n- **Overall sentiment**: While most participants lean toward supportive policies aimed at safeguarding collective health, a notable, vocal minority prioritizes personal liberty and skepticism about governmental authority. The discussion reflects a tension between public‑health imperatives and individual freedoms, with many respondents seeking a balanced approach that protects both.",
