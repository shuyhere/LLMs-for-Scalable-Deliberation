    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly leans toward allowing the government to enforce vaccination and quarantine during a severe epidemic, but most respondents add important conditions or reservations.\n\n**General support (≈70 %)**  \n- Many see mandatory measures as the most effective way to protect public health, achieve herd immunity, and prevent widespread illness and death.  \n- A large share emphasizes that enforcement is justified when an outbreak is truly severe, when vaccines are proven safe and effective, and when the measures are temporary or proportionate to the threat.\n\n**Qualified or conditional positions (≈15 %)**  \n- Some respondents advocate for quarantine mandates but oppose compulsory vaccination, citing concerns about rapid vaccine development and limited long‑term data.  \n- Others call for vaccines to be available and encouraged, but only made mandatory if the public can be fully informed and the program is funded without imposing financial burdens.\n\n**Opposition (≈15 %)**  \n- A minority stresses individual bodily autonomy, constitutional limits, and distrust of government authority, arguing that vaccination should remain a personal choice.  \n- These commenters also warn about potential side‑effects, historical mishandling of public health measures, and the risk of authoritarian overreach.\n\n**Cross‑cutting concerns**  \n- Transparency, scientific validation, and clear communication are repeatedly cited as essential prerequisites for any enforcement policy.  \n- Several comments note that enforcement should be coupled with support for the vulnerable and mechanisms to protect those who cannot safely receive vaccines.\n\nOverall, most participants endorse government enforcement during severe epidemics, provided the measures are justified by evidence, respect individual rights where possible, and are implemented transparently and responsibly.",
