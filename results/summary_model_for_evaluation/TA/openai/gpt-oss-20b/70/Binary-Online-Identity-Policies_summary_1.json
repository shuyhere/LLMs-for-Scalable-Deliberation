    "main_points": "The discussion shows a fairly even split between supporters and opponents of requiring real‑name registration on social media.  \n\n**Supporters (≈45 %)** emphasize that real names would increase accountability, reduce harassment, curb bots, protect minors, and help law‑enforcement investigate serious offenses. Many also see it as a way to discourage “bad” content and promote responsible online behavior.\n\n**Opponents (≈55 %)** argue that the policy would infringe on privacy, expose users to doxxing and data‑breach risks, and silence vulnerable or marginalized voices. A large share of these comments highlight concerns about government surveillance, corporate data misuse, and the loss of anonymity that protects people from harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.\n\n**Neutral or mixed views** (≈5 %) suggest a compromise: allowing optional real‑name registration, using verified identifiers rather than full disclosure, or limiting the visibility of the real name to authorities only.\n\nOverall, the debate centers on balancing safety and accountability against privacy, freedom of expression, and the right to remain anonymous.",
