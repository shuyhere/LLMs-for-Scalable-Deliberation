Around **70 %** express support, often framing it in terms of compassion, human rights, and the nation’s historical legacy of welcoming displaced peoples.  \n\nSupport is almost always coupled with a caveat: most respondents (approximately **55 %** of all comments) insist on **rigorous vetting, background checks, and clear limits** on the number of refugees admitted.  This group also stresses the importance of ensuring that refugees do not unduly strain public services or compete with existing citizens for resources.\n\nA smaller share—roughly **20 %**—expresses opposition or strong reservations.  Their concerns focus on economic burden, national security, and the belief that the U.S. should first address domestic problems before extending assistance abroad.  A few (around **5 %**) are ambivalent, acknowledging humanitarian needs but also highlighting practical limitations.\n\nApproximately **10 %** of the comments are neutral or undecided, often noting the need for more information or a balanced approach before taking a definitive stance.\n\nIn sum, while the dominant sentiment leans toward welcoming refugees, there is a pervasive emphasis on careful, measured implementation to balance humanitarian aims with national interests.",
