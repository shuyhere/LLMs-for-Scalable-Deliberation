    "main_points": "**Key Take‑aways**\n\n- **Majority view:** The tipping system is seen as over‑burdened, intrusive, and often unfair.  \n  *About 70 %* of comments call for a fundamental shift—removing or drastically reducing the practice, or making it optional rather than built‑in.  \n- **Living wage focus:** Over *65 %* advocate that workers in restaurants, bars, and other service roles should receive a livable base salary (often cited as $15 / hr or higher) so that tips become a bonus rather than a necessity.  \n- **Optional, quality‑based tipping:** Roughly *25 %* support keeping tipping, but insist it should be voluntary, tied strictly to the quality of service, and only applied to full‑service situations (e.g., sit‑down dining).  \n- **Alternative models:** Around *20 %* suggest a flat service charge (e.g., 10 %) or a European‑style “no‑tip” system that incorporates the cost of service into the menu price.  \n- **Screen‑prompt frustration:** A common grievance (appearing in *≈30 %* of comments) is that point‑of‑sale systems now automatically ask for tips, making it hard to decline or choose a lower amount.  \n- **Consumer‑worker balance:** About *15 %* emphasize that tipping should not be forced on consumers, especially for minimal or self‑service interactions (e.g., coffee shop pickups).  \n- **Mixed sentiments on tipping’s role:** While a minority (~10 %) view tipping as a necessary incentive for exceptional service, most see it as a “scam” or an unfair subsidy for underpaid workers.\n\n**Bottom line:** The conversation is dominated by calls to end or reform the tipping culture, with a strong push for higher base wages and optional, service‑quality‑driven gratuities. A smaller faction still values traditional tipping but wants clearer boundaries and less pressure on patrons.",
