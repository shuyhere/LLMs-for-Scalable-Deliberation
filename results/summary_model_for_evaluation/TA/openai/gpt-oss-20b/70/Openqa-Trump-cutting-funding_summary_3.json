    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the cuts to academic funding as a harmful move.  \nMost respondents (roughly three‑quarters) argue that the reductions will hurt students, limit research and innovation, and weaken the country’s long‑term competitiveness and social mobility.  Many of these voices frame the cuts as a political strategy to curb “left‑leaning” or “radical” academia and to keep the public less educated and more controllable.  \n\nA smaller portion (about fifteen percent) sees the cuts as a necessary correction for wasteful spending or believes that state and local entities should manage education funding.  A handful of participants express uncertainty or a lack of enough information to form an opinion.  \n\nSeveral comments note personal or specific institutional impacts—loss of scholarships, reduced faculty positions, and challenges for students who rely on federal support.  Overall, the tone is strongly negative toward the policy, with concerns about diminished research output, increased skill gaps, and broader societal risks.",
