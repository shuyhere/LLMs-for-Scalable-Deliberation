    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Positive impact (≈ 70 %)** – Most respondents report that AI has made their daily life easier, speeding up routine tasks, enhancing research, editing, and creative work. Many note higher productivity at work, better writing, and newfound confidence in problem‑solving. A large share also mention the convenience of instant information, improved learning, and the ability to generate ideas or design content quickly.\n\n- **Negative or cautious views (≈ 25 %)** – A noticeable minority express concerns about privacy, data collection, and job security. Some worry that AI may replace human roles, erode critical thinking, or spread misinformation. A few participants feel that AI makes them more skeptical of online content or that it introduces an unwanted level of dependence.\n\n- **Neutral or limited use (≈ 5 %)** – A small portion describe having little or no personal impact from AI, either because they rarely use it or because they see it only as an “advanced Google” tool.\n\n- **Common use‑case themes** – The comments highlight AI’s role in research and summarization, creative tasks (image editing, design, music), writing assistance (emails, proposals, academic work), educational support (homework help, language learning), and business applications (pricing research, policy drafting).\n\n- **Emerging concerns** – Beyond privacy and job security, respondents raise issues of authenticity (deep fakes, originality), over‑trust in AI outputs, and the need for regulation or ethical guidelines.\n\nOverall, the conversation reflects a strong inclination toward viewing AI as a productivity booster and creative ally, tempered by a substantive minority that cautions about its broader social and personal implications.",
