    "main_points": "**Overall Assessment of the Comments**\n\n- **Dominant Viewpoint (≈ 80 %)**  \n  The majority of comments express a clear belief that the current tariff policy will harm the U.S. economy.  Key concerns include:\n  * **Higher consumer prices** – most commenters note that tariffs are passed on to everyday goods, raising the cost of living and squeezing household budgets.\n  * **Negative impact on small and medium‑sized businesses** – many small‑business owners report delays, cancellations, and higher input costs that threaten their viability.\n  * **Retaliation and strained trade relationships** – several voices warn that other countries will impose their own tariffs, reducing export opportunities and increasing uncertainty for U.S. firms.\n  * **Economic slowdown and inflationary pressure** – the overall consensus is that the tariffs could dampen spending, slow growth, and contribute to a higher inflation rate.\n\n- **Positive Viewpoint (≈ 15 %)**  \n  A minority of comments argue that tariffs could bring long‑term benefits, such as:\n  * **Increased federal revenue** – some estimate a sizable boost to the treasury from tariff collections.\n  * **Protection and revival of domestic industries** – the idea that tariffs could encourage reshoring, support certain jobs, and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.\n  * **Strategic leverage in trade negotiations** – the notion that tariffs give the U.S. bargaining power to secure more favorable terms in future deals.\n\n- **Mixed or Conditional Viewpoint (≈ 5 %)**  \n  A handful of respondents acknowledge short‑term pain but anticipate eventual advantages.  They highlight the possibility that the negative effects may ease over time, allowing the policy to strengthen the U.S. economy in the long run.\n\n**Common Themes Across All Comments**\n\n| Theme | What People Say |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| **Price rise** | Almost every comment notes that tariffs increase the cost of goods for consumers. |\n| **Small‑business hardship** | Many small‑business owners report higher costs and disrupted supply chains. |\n| **Trade retaliation** | Frequent mention of other countries responding with their own tariffs, harming U.S. exports. |\n| **Economic uncertainty** | Concerns that unpredictable tariffs discourage investment and hurt global competitiveness. |\n| **Long‑term optimism** | A few voices believe that eventual job creation and revenue gains will outweigh the short‑term pain. |\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe prevailing consensus is that the tariff policy is presently a net negative for the broader U.S. economy, primarily due to higher consumer prices, increased costs for small businesses, and the risk of retaliatory trade actions.  While a minority see potential long‑term gains—particularly in revenue and domestic industry protection—the overall sentiment leans heavily toward the view that the tariffs are harming economic growth and consumer welfare in the near term.",
