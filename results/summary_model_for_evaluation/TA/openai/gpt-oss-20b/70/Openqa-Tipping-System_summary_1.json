    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n* **Strong opposition to the current tipping model** – about **70 %** of respondents view the existing system as unfair or coercive. They argue that it forces customers to tip in situations where no service is provided, that it pressures low‑wage workers, and that it encourages “tipping culture” that is hard to control.\n\n* **Living‑wage advocacy** – roughly **60 %** of comments call for employers to pay a livable wage (often cited as $15 / h in the U.S.) so that workers no longer need to rely on tips. Many see this as a way to eliminate the need for customer‑based wage supplements.\n\n* **Optional or limited tipping** – about **50 %** suggest that tipping should remain optional and tied to actual service quality. Proposals include removing mandatory prompts, offering a “no‑tip” choice on POS screens, and limiting tips to full‑service sit‑down restaurants or to workers who provide extra assistance.\n\n* **Alternative structures** – a notable minority (≈ 20 %) propose replacing tips with a flat service charge (e.g., 10 %) or a fixed tip amount (e.g., $20 or $30). Others reference European or Japanese models where service charges are built into the bill.\n\n* **Mixed views on the role of tips** – while many reject the current system, a smaller segment (≈ 15 %) still see tips as a legitimate incentive for outstanding service. They support higher tips for exceptional work but emphasize that tips should not be mandatory or expected for every purchase.\n\n* **Concerns about consumer burden** – several comments highlight the unpredictability and stress of deciding how much to tip, especially when service is poor or when tipping is prompted before any service is rendered.\n\n* **Calls for clearer policies** – many suggest clearer guidelines that tie tipping to specific services (e.g., only when a server actively serves a table) and a shift toward transparent, consistent billing practices.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward removing or drastically reforming the tipping system in favor of fairer wage structures and optional, service‑based gratuities.",
