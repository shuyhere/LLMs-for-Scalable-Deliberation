    "main_points": "The comments show a broad, mixed view of internet influencing as a profession.  \n- **Positive perspective (≈70 %)**: Many see influencers as a legitimate, creative career that democratizes media, offers economic opportunities, and can inform, entertain, and empower audiences. They appreciate the flexibility, the ability to reach niche communities, and the potential for entrepreneurship.  \n- **Critical perspective (≈25 %)**: A substantial minority raises concerns about authenticity, oversaturation, and the tendency to spread misinformation or excessive consumerism. They worry that the industry rewards superficiality, can mislead audiences, and may encourage unregulated or harmful content.  \n- **Practical concerns (≈5 %)**: A few comments focus on the work‑intensity, mental‑health implications for creators, and the need for clear standards, contracts, and media literacy education.  \n\nOverall, the discussion acknowledges that while internet influencing offers real opportunities and has reshaped how people consume and produce content, it also requires greater accountability, transparency, and thoughtful regulation to ensure it serves both creators and audiences responsibly.",
