    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly lean toward welcoming refugees, especially those fleeing war, persecution, or life‑threatening conditions.  \n- **Supportive sentiment** dominates, with roughly **70 %** expressing a willingness to accept refugees, often citing humanitarian duty, moral obligation, or the historical legacy of the United States as a refuge.  \n- A substantial subset—about **20 %**—adds conditions such as rigorous vetting, limits on numbers, or prioritization of resources for existing citizens. These respondents balance compassion with concerns about security, economic strain, or the capacity of public services.  \n- Only **10 %** of participants oppose expanding refugee intake, arguing that the country already faces enough internal challenges, that resources are stretched thin, or that immigration policies are already too permissive.  \n\nKey themes across the supportive comments include:  \n- **Humanitarian imperative:** The belief that the U.S. should provide a safe haven for those in danger.  \n- **Moral and historical duty:** Many reference the nation’s founding principles or past refugee experiences as justification.  \n- **Economic and social benefits:** A minority highlight potential gains in diversity, skills, and future economic contributions.  \n\nAmong the conditional voices, the most common concerns are:  \n- **Security and criminal background checks** to prevent abuse of the system.  \n- **Economic impact** on jobs, housing, and public services.  \n- **Fairness to existing citizens**, especially those already struggling.  \n\nOverall, the consensus is clear: most respondents support accepting refugees, but many want this to be done responsibly and within limits that protect national interests.",
