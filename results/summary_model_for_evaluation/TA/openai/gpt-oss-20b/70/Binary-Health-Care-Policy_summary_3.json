    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly favored government‑provided basic health insurance.  \n- **85 %** of the comments expressed support, citing health care as a human right, the need for preventive care, the fairness of universal coverage, and the potential for cost savings and stronger economic competitiveness.  \n- **12 %** opposed the idea, arguing that the private sector is better suited to deliver care, that a national program would be too costly, and that it could lower quality or restrict choice.  \n- **3 %** were conditional, supporting only a basic or public‑option plan, or expressing concerns about implementation details such as timeliness, scope of coverage, or taxpayer burden.  \n\nCommon themes among supporters included the moral obligation of the state, the current gaps in coverage for low‑income and unemployed individuals, and the comparison to other developed nations. Opponents highlighted concerns about efficiency, quality, and the size of the fiscal burden. Overall, the sentiment leaned strongly toward expanding government involvement in health insurance, with a minority wary of the potential drawbacks.",
