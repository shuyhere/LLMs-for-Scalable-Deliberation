    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nAcross the comments, the **majority (≈70 %) view the current tariff policy as having a negative impact** on the U.S. economy and society.  The most common concerns include:\n\n* **Higher consumer prices** – many note that tariffs will be passed on to households, reducing purchasing power and potentially slowing overall spending.  \n* **Negative effects on small businesses** – several participants mention that companies relying on imported inputs or exporting to foreign markets will suffer or be forced to relocate production.  \n* **Strained international relations** – a frequent point is that retaliatory tariffs and deteriorating trade ties could hurt U.S. competitiveness and damage the country’s diplomatic standing.  \n* **Inflationary pressures and slower growth** – the comments frequently link tariffs to rising inflation, higher costs for everyday goods, and a potential slowdown in economic expansion.  \n\nA smaller portion (≈20 %) see **positive or mixed outcomes**.  These comments highlight:\n\n* **Potential long‑term benefits** such as increased tariff revenue, a possible narrowing of the trade deficit, and protection of certain domestic industries and jobs.  \n* **Strategic advantages** – some argue that tariffs could encourage domestic production and make American products more competitive.  \n* **Political framing** – a few participants suggest that the policy may help rally support for the administration or signal a tougher stance on trade.\n\nA minority (≈10 %) express **mixed views**, acknowledging both short‑term hardships and possible long‑term gains, or recognizing that the policy may benefit certain sectors while harming others.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that tariffs are likely to **raise costs for consumers and businesses alike while imposing diplomatic and economic risks**, with a smaller group believing that any long‑term advantages could eventually offset these downsides.",
