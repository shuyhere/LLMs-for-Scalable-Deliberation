    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the decision to cut academic funding as a mistake that will hurt the nation’s future.  \n- **Sentiment:** About 95 % of the statements express concern, criticism, or outright opposition to the cuts. Roughly 3 % are neutral, acknowledging that the policy could be justified in some circumstances, while only 2 % praise or see benefits in the reduction.  \n- **Key concerns:**  \n  - **Education as the foundation of society**: many participants insist that schooling is essential for social stability and economic growth.  \n  - **Innovation and research**: several remarks warn that reduced funding will slow scientific breakthroughs, medical discoveries, and overall competitiveness.  \n  - **Social mobility and inequality**: commenters note that cuts disproportionately harm low‑income students and could widen existing disparities.  \n  - **Political motives**: a noticeable minority attributes the policy to a desire to suppress “left‑leaning” or “independent” thought in academia, linking it to authoritarian or anti‑democratic tendencies.  \n  - **Personal impact**: several voices mention how the cuts affect their own families, students they know, or their own research programs.  \n- **Remainder of the discourse**:  \n  - A few participants argue for a balanced approach—cautioning that some wasteful spending could be trimmed, but that a complete withdrawal would be harmful.  \n  - The few positive comments focus on the idea that universities may be misusing funds or that cutting certain programs (e.g., DEI initiatives) could be beneficial, though these views are not representative.\n\nOverall, the consensus is that the proposed funding reductions are short‑sighted and likely to undermine education, research, and the country’s long‑term prosperity.",
