    "main_points": "**Overall summary**\n\nA large portion of respondents (roughly **two‑thirds**) advocate for a major overhaul of the current tipping model.  \n*  **Elimination or heavy restriction of tipping** – Many argue that tipping is forced, often prompted automatically on digital point‑of‑sale screens, and that it places an unfair burden on consumers.  \n*  **Living‑wage or fair‑wage proposals** – The same group calls for employers to pay staff a livable base salary (or a higher minimum wage) so that tips become a bonus rather than a necessity.  \n*  **European‑style or flat‑fee alternatives** – A minority within this larger group suggests adopting a built‑in service charge or a fixed fee (e.g., 10 % or a set dollar amount) that would replace the discretionary tip.\n\nA smaller segment (around **a quarter**) supports keeping tipping but insists it should be **optional and tied to the quality of service**. They favor:\n*  Removing pre‑selected percentages, offering a “no tip” or $0 button, and allowing customers to decide how much to give.  \n*  Maintaining the practice for full‑service restaurants and delivery workers, but not for counter‑service, take‑out, or fast‑food settings.  \n*  Some suggest modest standard tips (10–15 %) and higher amounts for exceptional service.\n\nThe remaining **10 %** are either neutral or mildly supportive of the current system, often citing personal experience as a server or a belief that tipping is simply part of the culture.  \n\nOverall, the consensus leans strongly toward reducing or eliminating the mandatory or automatic tipping requirement and ensuring that workers receive a fair baseline wage, while a notable minority still values tipping as a discretionary reward for good service.",
