    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nAround **55 %** of respondents opposed a mandatory real‑name requirement on social media, citing privacy, safety, and freedom‑of‑expression concerns. Roughly **35 %** supported it, arguing that it would curb harassment, scams, and fake accounts, while **10 %** expressed mixed or conditional views (e.g., supportive of optional verification or platform‑specific mandates).  \n\n**Key Themes**\n\n| Theme | Supporting Arguments | Opposing Arguments |\n|-------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **Privacy & Data Security** | Real‑name data can be verified, reducing identity theft and fraud. | Collecting full identities invites doxxing, surveillance, and misuse by both companies and governments. |\n| **Safety & Harassment** | Accountability may deter cyber‑bullying, hate speech, and predatory behaviors. | Mandatory disclosure can expose vulnerable users (e.g., domestic‑violence victims, whistle‑blowers) to real‑world retaliation. |\n| **Freedom of Expression** | Users may feel more honest when accountable. | Anonymity protects dissenting voices and encourages open dialogue, especially on political or sensitive topics. |\n| **Platform Integrity** | Reduces bots, catfishing, and fake accounts, improving trust. | Enforcement is difficult; users can still create alternate identities or use pseudonyms. |\n| **Context‑Specific** | Some platforms (LinkedIn, professional networks) may benefit more from real names. | Others (Reddit, subversive forums) rely on anonymity to fulfill their purpose. |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe debate pivots on a trade‑off: stronger accountability versus stronger privacy. A majority of respondents feared that forcing real‑name registration would erode anonymity, expose users to risk, and concentrate data in the hands of platforms and governments. A sizable minority saw it as a practical tool to reduce harassment and fake activity, especially on larger, mainstream platforms. The discussion remains nuanced, with many advocating for optional or platform‑appropriate solutions rather than a blanket mandate.",
