    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Support for real‑name registration:** Roughly **60 %** of the comments express a positive view of requiring users to register with and post under their real names.  The main arguments cited are that it would curb harassment, reduce scams and bots, increase accountability, and make it harder for predators to operate anonymously.\n\n- **Opposition to the requirement:** About **30 %** of the comments oppose the policy.  Their concerns center on privacy invasion, the risk of doxxing and stalking, the potential for abuse by platforms or governments, and the erosion of free expression for vulnerable or marginalized users.\n\n- **Conditional or mixed positions:** The remaining **10 %** of comments are nuanced.  These participants agree that accountability matters but suggest the policy should be optional, limited to certain types of platforms (e.g., professional or verified accounts), or accompanied by strong safeguards and privacy protections.\n\n- **Common themes across all groups:**\n  - **Privacy vs. safety** is the dominant tension; many note that real‑name registration can help prevent abuse but also expose users to new risks.\n  - **Platform responsibility** is frequently mentioned.  Some see it as a platform‑level decision, while others frame it as a government‑driven mandate.\n  - **Impact on marginalized voices** is a recurring concern, with objections that anonymity can protect those who fear retaliation or discrimination.\n  - **Effectiveness** is questioned by a few who believe determined abusers will still find ways around verification.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a split view: most participants see value in real‑name registration for reducing harmful behavior, yet a substantial minority raise serious privacy and safety objections that could outweigh the benefits for certain user groups.",
