    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly express concern that the cuts will weaken the nation’s educational and research infrastructure.  \n- **Education quality & student access**: About 80 % of respondents fear that reduced funding will shrink opportunities for students, increase class sizes, cut programs, and leave vulnerable groups—especially low‑income and special‑needs students—without needed support.  \n- **Research & innovation**: Roughly 70 % cite the loss of grant money as a threat to scientific progress, medical breakthroughs, and the country’s competitive edge.  \n- **Economic and workforce impact**: A majority link the cuts to future skill gaps, a less competitive labor market, and higher long‑term costs.  \n- **Political motives**: Nearly 30 % argue the decision is driven by ideology, targeting universities that promote DEI or “woke” agendas, or by a desire to keep the electorate less educated.  \n- **Opposing view**: A minority (around 10 %) see the cuts as a necessary correction of over‑funding, a way to reduce federal involvement, or a measure to curb perceived ideological bias in academia.  \n- **Uncertainty or neutrality**: About 5 % express ambivalence or lack of information, indicating a need for clearer details on what is being cut and how.  \n\nOverall, the sentiment leans strongly toward the belief that trimming academic budgets will harm students, research, and the broader economy, while a small segment sees it as a corrective or politically motivated move.",
