    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **General stance**: The majority of respondents view government authority to enforce vaccination and quarantine as a necessary tool during severe epidemics. They emphasize that such powers help protect public health, achieve herd immunity, and prevent widespread illness and death.\n\n- **Conditions and caveats**  \n  -  A large share of supporters insist that enforcement should **only** apply when an outbreak is truly severe, the disease highly transmissible, or when the vaccine’s safety and efficacy are verified.  \n  -  Many call for **transparent oversight**, clear scientific guidance, and the right to access vaccine information before compliance is demanded.  \n  -  Quarantine is almost universally seen as acceptable, whereas mandatory vaccination is more contested—some support it as a public‑health imperative, while others view it as an intrusion on bodily autonomy.\n\n- **Opposition**  \n  -  Those against enforcement argue that it infringes on individual rights, can lead to abuse of power, and may erode public trust.  \n  -  Concerns about vaccine safety, side‑effects, and insufficient long‑term data drive opposition.  \n  -  A minority express that any form of mandate is inherently authoritarian, regardless of the epidemic’s severity.\n\n- **Mixed or conditional views**  \n  -  Several respondents support enforcement **only** if it is proportionate, legally justified, and accompanied by strong safeguards (e.g., financial coverage, penalties for non‑compliance, or the ability to opt out for medical reasons).  \n  -  Some highlight the importance of voluntary participation, incentives, or targeted restrictions (e.g., limiting unvaccinated individuals from certain venues) rather than blanket mandates.\n\n- **Key themes**  \n  - **Public safety vs personal liberty**: The debate centers on balancing collective health benefits against individual freedom to choose.  \n  - **Trust in government**: Confidence in public‑health agencies strongly influences support; mistrust fuels opposition.  \n  - **Effectiveness and historical precedent**: Many point to past successes (polio, measles) and failures (COVID‑19 response) to justify or critique mandates.\n\nIn short, while most respondents favor some level of government enforcement during serious health crises, they largely call for clear limits, scientific validation, and respect for personal choice where possible.",
