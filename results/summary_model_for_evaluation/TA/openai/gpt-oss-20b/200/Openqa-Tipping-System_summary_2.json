    "main_points": "**Overall summary**\n\nA large share of respondents feel that the current tipping system is over‑extended and often creates pressure on both customers and workers. Many argue that workers—especially in the food‑service sector—are paid wages that are far below a livable standard, and that tips are used to subsidise this shortfall rather than reward exceptional service. Consequently, a majority call for a shift toward a model where employers provide a living wage and tipping becomes a voluntary, bonus‑type gesture rather than a de‑facto requirement.\n\nAt the same time, a significant proportion still see value in tipping as a way to acknowledge good service. These respondents would prefer tipping to remain an option tied to the quality of the experience, and many suggest clear guidelines or lower default tip rates (e.g., 10–15 %) to ease the burden on customers.\n\nA common theme across the comments is the desire for clearer, less intrusive payment flows. Several participants advocate for a built‑in “service fee” or a flat charge that is already included in the menu price, mirroring practices in many European countries. Others propose that electronic payment systems offer a zero‑tip option and that tip prompts should only appear when a direct, personalized service has been delivered.\n\nOverall, respondents lean toward a future where workers receive a guaranteed, livable base wage; tipping, if it remains, is optional, tied to service quality, and presented in a transparent, non‑pressuring manner.",
