    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA large majority of the comments view the tariff policy as a **negative** influence on the U.S. economy and society.  \n- **Price‑inflation concerns** dominate: most respondents point out that tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which is passed on to consumers, eroding purchasing power and driving inflation.  \n- **Small‑business and supply‑chain worries**: many cite the burden on small manufacturers and traders who rely on foreign inputs, noting layoffs, higher costs, and reduced competitiveness.  \n- **Trade‑relation fallout**: several comments highlight retaliatory tariffs, strained U.S. relationships with China and other partners, and the potential for a broader trade war that could hurt exports.  \n- **Mixed or conditional views**: a minority believe the policy could be beneficial in the long run by protecting domestic industries, creating jobs, or boosting federal revenue, but they typically frame this benefit as contingent on future adjustments or a stable economic environment.\n\n**Percentages (approximate)**  \n- **Negative impact**: ~75%  \n- **Positive or conditional impact**: ~10%  \n- **Mixed/uncertain**: ~15%\n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n1. **Consumer costs rise** – most respondents see tariffs as a tax on ordinary Americans.  \n2. **Small businesses feel the squeeze** – many comment on the direct effect on their operations.  \n3. **Trade relationships suffer** – retaliation and uncertainty are cited as major risks.  \n4. **Long‑term benefits are debated** – while some hope for eventual job creation or revenue gains, these are viewed as uncertain and secondary to immediate economic pain.",
