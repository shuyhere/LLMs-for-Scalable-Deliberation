    "main_points": "**Overall sentiment**\n\nThe bulk of the comments view the current tariff policy as a net negative for the U.S. economy and society.  \n\n- **Negative impact** – ≈ 90 % of the remarks highlight higher consumer prices, inflation, reduced purchasing power, supply‑chain disruptions, and strained trade relations. Many note that the burden is shifted onto consumers, that small businesses suffer, and that retaliatory tariffs from other nations could worsen the situation.  \n- **Positive or mixed impact** – ≈ 10 % of the remarks express optimism that tariffs will protect domestic industries, increase federal revenue, encourage reshoring, and ultimately benefit the U.S. over the long term. These comments tend to emphasize potential job creation and a level‑playing field for American manufacturers.\n\n**Key themes**\n\n| Theme | What the comments say | General tone |\n|-------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| **Higher prices & inflation** | “Tariffs raise costs for consumers, make everything more expensive.” | Strongly negative |\n| **Trade retaliation / global isolation** | “Other countries impose tariffs on U.S. goods; we lose soft power.” | Negative |\n| **Small‑business hardship** | “Tariffs hurt small manufacturers and artists who import from China.” | Negative |\n| **Potential long‑term benefits** | “May bring jobs back, increase revenue, protect domestic sectors.” | Mixed/optimistic |\n| **Uncertainty & short‑term pain** | “Short‑term hurt, long‑term possible gains.” | Mixed |\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nWhile a minority see possible future gains, the overwhelming majority of respondents perceive the tariff policy as damaging to consumer welfare, trade relationships, and overall economic stability in the near‑term. The consensus suggests that the costs—particularly higher prices and inflation—outweigh any short‑term or speculative benefits.",
