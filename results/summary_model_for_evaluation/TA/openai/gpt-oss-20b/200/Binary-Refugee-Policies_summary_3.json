    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Dominant view**: A clear majority of respondents see accepting refugees fleeing war or persecution as a moral and humanitarian imperative.  \n  - Approximately **70 %** of the comments affirm a supportive stance, often citing the United States’ history of welcoming displaced peoples, the right to safety, and the benefits of diversity and global solidarity.  \n  - Many supporters emphasize that this responsibility should be balanced with rigorous **vetting** and **resource planning**, expressing a preference for **limited or controlled intake** rather than an open‑border approach.\n\n- **Key concerns of the supportive minority**:  \n  - **Security**: fear that some refugees might pose a risk or have criminal backgrounds.  \n  - **Economic strain**: worries about the fiscal impact on public services and the potential for competition with U.S. citizens for jobs, housing, and healthcare.  \n  - **Domestic priorities**: belief that the country should first address internal problems such as poverty, homelessness, and infrastructure before expanding refugee intake.\n\n- **Opposing sentiment**: Roughly **25 %** of comments reject or strongly question expanding refugee admissions.  \n  - The opposition is largely driven by **resource and capacity constraints**, **perceived exploitation** of the system by “fake” refugees, and an emphasis on **protecting American citizens**.  \n  - Some comments link current U.S. foreign policy or historical wars to the refugee influx, arguing that the nation should not be complicit in creating more refugees.\n\n- **Neutral or ambivalent positions**: About **5 %** of comments express uncertainty, suggest a “case‑by‑case” approach, or call for a **shared global burden**.  \n  - These respondents acknowledge the humanitarian need but also highlight the complexities of implementing policy in a strained immigration system.\n\n- **Recurring themes across all positions**:  \n  - **Humanitarian duty** and the moral obligation to protect those in life‑threatening situations.  \n  - **Need for structured integration**—educational programs, sponsorship, and community support—to ensure refugees become productive members of society.  \n  - **Balancing act**: many stress that any policy must weigh the welfare of refugees against the well‑being of existing citizens.\n\nIn sum, while a majority view the U.S. as a rightful haven for refugees, a significant minority voices caution about security, fiscal burden, and domestic priorities. The prevailing narrative calls for a **measured, well‑vetted approach** that upholds humanitarian values while safeguarding national interests.",
