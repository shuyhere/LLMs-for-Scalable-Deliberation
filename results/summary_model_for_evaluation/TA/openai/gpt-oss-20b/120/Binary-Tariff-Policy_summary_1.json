A large share—roughly **80 %**—focus on higher consumer prices, inflation, and reduced purchasing power.  Many respondents point to the burden on small businesses, the risk of retaliation from trading partners, and the likelihood that costs will be passed on to the average consumer.  Several also note that the tariffs may undermine U.S. competitiveness and erode soft power.\n\nA smaller portion—around **15 %**—argues that tariffs could ultimately benefit the economy by generating revenue, protecting domestic industries, and encouraging the reshoring of jobs.  These comments tend to emphasize long‑term gains and the strategic advantage of imposing duties on foreign producers.\n\nA minority—approximately **5 %**—offer a mixed view, acknowledging short‑term pain but expecting eventual positive outcomes, or highlighting uncertainty and the need for better negotiation tactics.\n\nIn short, most participants see the tariffs as a net negative for the U.S. economy and society, while a minority believes they may offer strategic or fiscal benefits in the longer run.",
