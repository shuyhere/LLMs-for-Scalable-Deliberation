They highlight forced charger changes, discontinued support, and “cash‑grab” marketing. | ~35 % |\n| **Environmental & financial impact** | Concerns about electronic waste, resource consumption, and the cost of buying new devices every year are frequently mentioned. | ~30 % |\n| **Security & reliability** | Some appreciate regular updates for safety, while others experience bugs, data privacy worries, or loss of functionality after an update. | ~20 % |\n| **Desire for a slower cadence** | A notable minority calls for 2‑year or longer release cycles, better repairability, and more focus on software support. | ~25 % |\n\n**Overall Takeaway**\n\nA significant portion of respondents see rapid updates as a *necessary evil* that keeps devices secure and competitive, yet they simultaneously criticize the pace for being largely driven by profit motives, leading to unnecessary spending and environmental harm. While a smaller group appreciates the speed for keeping up with new tech, the majority express frustration with incremental improvements, bugs, and the pressure to replace devices before they truly become obsolete. The conversation overall underscores a call for more sustainable practices—longer product lifespans, stronger repair options, and clearer communication about meaningful upgrades—while balancing the benefits that rapid innovation can bring.",
