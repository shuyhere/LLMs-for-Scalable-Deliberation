    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe majority of respondents view the current tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy. A large share—about **80 %**—express concerns that tariffs raise consumer prices, increase inflation, and burden small businesses, leading to higher costs for everyday goods, reduced consumer spending, and potential job losses. Many also point to strained trade relations, especially with China, and warn that retaliatory tariffs could further disrupt global supply chains.\n\nA minority—roughly **15 %**—highlight potential upside. These comments suggest that tariffs could generate revenue for the Treasury, protect domestic industries, and eventually encourage the reshoring of jobs. Some see the policy as a strategic tool to renegotiate trade agreements or to level the playing field against countries that undercut U.S. producers.\n\nA small fraction, about **5 %**, offer mixed or neutral views, noting that the short‑term costs are clear but long‑term benefits are uncertain, or that the policy’s effects vary across sectors.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Negative Impact:** Rising prices, inflation, consumer hardship, and diminished trade relationships dominate the discussion.  \n- **Potential Benefits:** Revenue gains, industry protection, and job‑shifting are cited by a minority as long‑term positives.  \n- **Uncertainty:** A few respondents acknowledge that the policy’s ultimate effect is still unclear and may differ by industry.",
