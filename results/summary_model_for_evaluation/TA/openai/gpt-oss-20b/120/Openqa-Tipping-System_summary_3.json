    "main_points": "Most respondents see the current U.S. tipping practice as **over‑burdening both customers and workers**.  \n- **A majority** (roughly 60 %) call for a **reduction or elimination** of tipping altogether, arguing that it is a forced expense that encourages low base wages.  \n- **Around 30 %** favor **keeping tipping** but only for *high‑quality, full‑service* encounters, insisting that staff should receive a **living wage** or a **service charge** that is built into the bill.  \n- **A small minority** (≈10 %) view the current system as acceptable, provided it remains optional and is used for genuine service excellence.  \n\nCommon proposals include:  \n- **Replacing tips with a flat service fee** (often 10 %) or a **fixed amount** on the bill.  \n- **Introducing an explicit “no tip” option** on electronic payment screens.  \n- **Raising minimum wage or ensuring a living wage** for service staff so that tips become a bonus rather than a necessity.  \n- **Restricting tipping to sit‑down or truly personal service** (e.g., restaurants, delivery, hairdressing) and discouraging it for quick‑serve or counter‑service.  \n\nOverall, the conversation centers on **fair compensation for workers** and **removing the cultural pressure** on consumers to tip, while still allowing a gesture of appreciation for outstanding service.",
