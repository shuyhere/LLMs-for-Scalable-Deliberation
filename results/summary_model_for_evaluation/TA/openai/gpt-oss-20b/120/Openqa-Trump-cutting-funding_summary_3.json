    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly expresses concern that trimming federal support for higher‑education and research will hurt students, scholars, and the nation’s competitive edge.  \n- **Negative sentiment dominates**: roughly four‑fifths of the comments warn that the cuts will reduce opportunities for learning, stall scientific progress, and deepen social and economic inequities.  \n- **Political framing**: many respondents see the decision as a deliberate attempt to suppress critical thinking and empower a politically aligned elite, citing motives such as “wokeness” or a desire to keep the population uneducated.  \n- **Impact on research and innovation**: a large portion of participants highlight the risk of losing world‑class research, brain‑drain, and the long‑term cost of diminished scientific output.  \n- **Concerns for students and families**: several comments note that families already struggling to afford college will be hit harder, while some point to the negative effects on K‑12 schools that rely on federal aid.  \n- **Calls for balance**: a minority suggest that some spending could be trimmed, but only if it comes from institutions with large endowments and if alternate funding is secured; they argue for a more measured approach rather than blanket cuts.  \n- **Uncertainty and misinformation**: a few respondents admit lack of knowledge about the specifics of the cuts, indicating a need for clearer communication and more detailed data.  \n\nIn sum, the prevailing view is that the policy is harmful, driven by partisan motives, and likely to undermine the United States’ educational and research foundations. The few voices that see potential savings or reallocation of funds are outweighed by those warning of long‑term damage to learners, scholars, and the economy.",
