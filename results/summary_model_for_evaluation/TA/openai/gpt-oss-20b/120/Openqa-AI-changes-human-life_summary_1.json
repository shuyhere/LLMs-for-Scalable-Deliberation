These concerns are often coupled with a broader anxiety about surveillance or corporate use of AI.  \n\n- **Job‑Security Anxiety (≈ 20 %)**:  \n  Some respondents fear that AI could replace human roles, especially in repetitive or creative positions.  The tension between AI as a helper and as a competitor is a recurring theme.  \n\n- **Misinformation & Trust Issues (≈ 15 %)**:  \n  A smaller group warns that AI can spread inaccuracies, deep‑fakes, or biased content, leading to mistrust of information online and a feeling that critical thinking is being eroded.  \n\n- **Limited or Neutral Impact (≈ 10 %)**:  \n  A handful of comments indicate that AI has had little influence on their lives, usually citing sporadic or minimal use for simple tasks.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n1. **Most users find AI a powerful productivity booster and learning aid.**  \n2. **Creative professionals increasingly view AI as a collaborative partner, though some worry about originality.**  \n3. **Privacy, job security, and misinformation remain significant concerns for a substantial minority.**  \n4. **Overall sentiment leans toward a net positive experience, with many users feeling that AI has become an indispensable part of daily life, while also recognizing the need for mindful use and regulation.**",
