    "main_points": "**Summary of the tipping‑system discussion**\n\n- **Core critique of the current model** – Most comments describe the U.S. tipping system as over‑extended, intrusive, and a mechanism that lets employers pay workers far below a living wage. Many point out that customers are prompted to tip even for minimal or counter‑service, creating discomfort and confusion.  \n- **Call for a living‑wage alternative** – Over two‑thirds of respondents advocate for eliminating tipping altogether or making it optional by ensuring staff receive a fair base salary. They note that tipping is a “necessary evil” only because wages are too low.  \n- **Optional, service‑based tipping** – A significant minority support keeping tipping but only for genuine, high‑quality service. They favor a system that lets customers decide whether to tip and how much, rather than being forced by a digital prompt.  \n- **Flat‑fee or service‑charge proposals** – Some suggest replacing the percentage‑based tip with a fixed service fee (e.g., 10 %) that would be added to the bill, similar to models used in Europe. This could simplify the process and make the cost clearer to consumers.  \n- **European‑style “no‑tipping” model** – A smaller group recommends adopting the European approach where tipping is optional and workers are paid a full living wage, arguing that this removes the pressure on customers and stabilizes worker income.  \n- **Practical adjustments** – A handful of comments propose small changes such as a clearly visible “no tip” option on point‑of‑sale devices, reducing suggested tip percentages, or providing a thank‑you note or coupon in return for a tip.  \n- **Mixed feelings about tipping itself** – While many dislike the expectation to tip, a minority still see it as a meaningful way to reward exceptional service, especially in restaurant or delivery contexts.  \n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward reforming or abolishing the current tipping framework in favor of fair wages, optional tipping tied to quality, or a standardized service charge.",
