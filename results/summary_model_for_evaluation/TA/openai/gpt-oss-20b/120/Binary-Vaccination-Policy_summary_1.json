    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nA substantial body of respondents believes that a government should have the authority to enforce vaccination and quarantine measures during a severe epidemic or pandemic.  The most common arguments in favor are:\n\n* **Public‑health protection** – Mandates are seen as the quickest way to achieve herd immunity, stop the spread of disease, and save lives.  \n* **Scientific evidence** – Supporters cite proven vaccine efficacy and the need to act while scientific data are still evolving.  \n* **Collective responsibility** – Many view it as the government’s duty to step in when individual actions could threaten community health.  \n* **Conditional acceptance** – A large portion of the supportive voices state that such power is acceptable only in the face of a serious outbreak, if the vaccines are proven safe, or if enforcement is paired with free‑choice options, incentives, or strong oversight.\n\nOpposition, while smaller, is strongly articulated around:\n\n* **Bodily autonomy** – The right to decide what is put into one’s body is a central concern.  \n* **Trust in government** – Several respondents cite past missteps, misinformation, or perceived overreach as reasons to reject mandates.  \n* **Potential harms and side‑effects** – Some fear that vaccines, especially those rolled out quickly, may cause long‑term health issues.  \n* **Alternative approaches** – Education, incentives, voluntary compliance, and targeted restrictions (rather than blanket mandates) are suggested as sufficient.\n\nA minority of comments are conditional or neutral, calling for a balanced approach that limits government power, uses evidence‑based criteria, or relies on voluntary participation.\n\n**Approximate split (based on the content of all comments)**  \n* **Supportive stance** – about 60 % of participants.  \n* **Opposing stance** – about 30 %.  \n* **Conditional/nuanced stance** – about 10 %.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans toward favoring governmental enforcement of vaccination and quarantine when an epidemic is severe, but many participants stress the importance of safeguards, transparency, and respect for individual choice.",
