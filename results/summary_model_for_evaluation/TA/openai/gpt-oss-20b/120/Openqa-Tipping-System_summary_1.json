    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong consensus that the current tipping model is heavily criticized for being over‑reached, unfair, and coupled with low base wages.  \n- **Elimination or major redesign**: A majority see tipping as unnecessary or harmful and advocate for its removal, replacement with a flat service fee, or making tips optional.  \n- **Living wage emphasis**: Many respondents call for employers to raise wages to a living level so that tips become a bonus rather than a necessity.  \n- **Conditional support**: Those who still value tipping generally feel it should be tied to quality of service, restricted to sit‑down or full‑service contexts, and that the option to tip 0 should be available.  \n- **System improvements**: Suggested changes include clearer “no‑tip” choices on digital receipts, fixed tip amounts instead of percentages, and better communication about when a tip is appropriate.  \n\nOverall, the discussion leans toward reducing or eliminating the tipping requirement, ensuring fair base pay for service workers, and preserving the option for consumers to reward exceptional service voluntarily.",
