    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Majority view**: A sizable share of respondents see government‑mandated vaccination and quarantine as a legitimate tool for protecting public health during serious epidemics. They argue that such measures prevent disease spread, save lives, and safeguard vulnerable populations, and most of them believe the policy should be applied only when the threat is severe.\n\n- **Opposition**: A noticeable minority rejects mandatory policies, citing concerns about bodily autonomy, vaccine safety, and the potential for government overreach. Some respondents also distrust the authorities that made pandemic‑related decisions in the past.\n\n- **Nuanced positions**: Many respondents fall somewhere between the two extremes. They either support enforcement only under strict conditions (e.g., only when the epidemic is truly severe, vaccines are proven safe, or the policy is backed by scientific evidence) or they favor strong encouragement rather than compulsion. A few argue that enforcement should be limited to quarantine, while vaccination should remain voluntary.\n\n- **Key themes**:\n  - **Public safety vs. individual rights**: The tension between collective welfare and personal choice is the most frequently cited reason for disagreement.\n  - **Trust in science and government**: Those who trust the scientific consensus and the government’s pandemic response are more likely to endorse mandates; skepticism about vaccine development timelines or perceived political motives fuels opposition.\n  - **Severity threshold**: Even among supporters, there is a strong preference for limiting mandates to situations where the risk of widespread illness or death is high, rather than making them permanent fixtures.\n\n- **Statistical snapshot**: Roughly **60 %** of comments support the idea of government enforcement—often with qualifiers—while about **25 %** oppose it outright. The remaining **15 %** express conditional or mixed views that blend support and concern.",
