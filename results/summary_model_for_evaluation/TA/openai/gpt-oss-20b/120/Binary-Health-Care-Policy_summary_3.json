    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA substantial majority of respondents view government‑run or government‑funded health insurance as a necessary public good.  Roughly **over 90 %** express support, citing arguments such as:\n\n| Theme | Typical Rationale |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| **Human right / equity** | Health care is a basic right that should not be tied to income, employment, or geographic location. |\n| **Cost and affordability** | Private insurance is too expensive for many; a universal plan would reduce financial hardship and prevent medical debt or bankruptcy. |\n| **Public health and productivity** | Accessible care leads to earlier treatment, better outcomes, and a healthier, more productive workforce. |\n| **Comparison to other nations** | Other advanced economies provide universal coverage; the U.S. is an outlier and should follow suit. |\n| **Government efficiency** | Governments can negotiate prices and streamline care, potentially lowering overall spending. |\n\nA minority—about **10 %**—express reservations or outright opposition.  Their concerns focus on:\n\n| Concern | Typical Reasoning |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Cost to taxpayers** | Implementing universal coverage would strain public finances and could require higher taxes or cuts to other services. |\n| **Government inefficiency** | Past experience suggests that large bureaucracies can be slow, wasteful, or produce lower‑quality care. |\n| **Loss of choice** | Mandatory coverage may reduce consumer options, delay appointments, or limit access to certain specialists and medications. |\n| **Potential for over‑regulation** | Excessive government control could stifle innovation and limit provider competition. |\n\nIn summary, most participants see universal health insurance as a **fundamental right** that would promote fairness, reduce financial risk, and improve national health outcomes, while a smaller group raises **economic and efficiency** concerns about the feasibility and desirability of widespread government intervention.",
