    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of Comments**\n\n- **General Support with Conditions (≈ 55 %)**  \n  Most respondents favor accepting refugees fleeing war or persecution, but almost all add stipulations. Common conditions include:\n  - Thorough background checks and vetting to screen out criminals or security risks.  \n  - Limiting numbers or setting quotas to avoid overwhelming local resources.  \n  - Ensuring that U.S. citizens’ needs are not neglected while refugees are accommodated.  \n  - Providing education and integration programs to help refugees adjust to American society.\n\n- **Moral and Humanitarian Argument (≈ 25 %)**  \n  A sizable group emphasizes the U.S.’s historical and ethical duty to protect those in extreme danger, citing:\n  - The country’s founding as a refuge for the persecuted.  \n  - A moral obligation to aid human rights victims worldwide.  \n  - The belief that helping refugees reflects American values of freedom and compassion.\n\n- **Domestic Resource Concerns (≈ 20 %)**  \n  Several comments express worry that accepting additional refugees would strain public services, finance, or infrastructure. These concerns focus on:\n  - Existing debt and economic challenges in the U.S.  \n  - Competition for jobs, housing, and social services with native citizens.  \n  - Potential increase in crime or social friction.\n\n- **National Security and Legal Concerns (≈ 15 %)**  \n  A minority voice stresses the importance of safeguarding national security by ensuring refugees pose no threat, and that the immigration system remains robust and resistant to abuse.\n\n- **Mixed or Uncertain Positions (≈ 10 %)**  \n  Some respondents are on the fence, acknowledging both the need for compassion and the practical limitations of current U.S. immigration policy. Others admit lacking enough information to form a definitive stance.\n\n- **Opposition (≈ 5 %)**  \n  A small portion outright opposes expanding refugee intake, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens, that the current system is already overloaded, or that refugees may exploit the system.\n\n**Key Takeaway**  \nThe prevailing sentiment is supportive of refugee acceptance, provided that the U.S. implements robust vetting, limits intake to sustainable levels, and safeguards domestic needs. The debate centers on balancing humanitarian ideals with practical concerns about resources, security, and social cohesion.",
