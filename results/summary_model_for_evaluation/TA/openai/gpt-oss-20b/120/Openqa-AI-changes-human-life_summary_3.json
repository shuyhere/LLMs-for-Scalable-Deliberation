Many highlight increased productivity at work and home, easier information retrieval, and comfort in generating content such as emails, resumes, or artistic ideas.  A noticeable portion, however, voice reservations: concerns about privacy, the potential loss of jobs, and the spread of misinformation or deep‑fakes.  A smaller group reports limited use or little impact on their lives, often noting that they rely on AI only for specific, occasional needs.  Overall, the sentiment is largely positive, tempered by a meaningful awareness of the ethical and practical challenges that accompany widespread AI adoption.",
