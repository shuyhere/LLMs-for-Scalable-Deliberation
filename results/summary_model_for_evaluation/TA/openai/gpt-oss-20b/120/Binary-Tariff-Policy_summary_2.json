    "main_points": "**Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Dominant View** – The vast majority of respondents see the tariff policy as a net **negative** for the U.S. economy and society.  \n- **Common Arguments**  \n  * **Higher Prices & Inflation** – Almost all negative comments cite rising consumer costs, inflation, and reduced purchasing power.  \n  * **Small‑Business Strain** – Many point to tariffs dragging up import costs for small‑scale producers and retailers.  \n  * **Trade‑Tension & Isolation** – Several comments warn that tariffs damage U.S. relationships with China and other partners, leading to retaliatory measures and a less favorable trade environment.  \n  * **Limited Domestic Gains** – Even those who acknowledge some protection of domestic industries argue the benefits are marginal and short‑lived.  \n\n- **Positive Perspective (≈7 %)**  \n  * **Revenue & Job Creation** – A small minority argues that tariffs raise federal revenues, protect jobs, and ultimately strengthen the domestic sector.  \n  * **Long‑Term Strategic Gains** – Some see the policy as a necessary step to rebalance trade and reduce dependence on foreign manufacturing.  \n\n- **Mixed or Uncertain Views (≈5 %)**  \n  * A handful express ambivalence, noting short‑term pain but potential long‑term benefits, or uncertainty about the net effect.\n\n**Bottom Line**  \nThe prevailing sentiment is that the current tariff regime imposes immediate costs on consumers, businesses, and international trade relations, while the projected long‑term advantages are viewed as limited or uncertain by most commentators.",
