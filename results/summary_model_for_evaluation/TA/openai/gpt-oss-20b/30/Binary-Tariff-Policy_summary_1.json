    "main_points": "Most respondents view the current tariff policy as a net drag on the U.S. economy.  They point to higher consumer prices, increased costs for businesses, and the risk of damaging trade relationships—especially with China—as the main concerns.  A sizeable group also worries that the tariffs will not succeed in reshoring industry, will erode the U.S. image as a fair trading partner, and could push the country toward isolation and economic hardship.\n\nA smaller segment believes the tariffs could bring positive outcomes.  These comments highlight potential gains in federal revenue, protection for certain domestic industries, and long‑term stabilization of the economy.  Some even argue that the policy will encourage consumers to buy more American goods.\n\nSeveral comments describe a mixed picture, noting that while short‑term costs are high, there may be long‑term benefits, or that the impact will vary across sectors and households.  These respondents emphasize uncertainty and the possibility that the policy’s effects will unfold over time.\n\nIn summary, the discussion is dominated by concerns about negative economic and relational consequences, with a minority seeing potential benefits and a third group recognizing the complexity and uncertainty of the tariff’s overall impact.",
