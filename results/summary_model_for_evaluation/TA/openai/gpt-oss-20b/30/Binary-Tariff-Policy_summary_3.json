    "main_points": "The overall mood of the discussion is strongly negative.  \n- About **23 %** of the comments expressed a clear positive view, citing benefits such as increased tariff revenue, support for domestic industry, and long‑term economic stability.  \n- Roughly **67 %** were unequivocally negative, warning of higher consumer prices, inflation, weakened trade relations, and a potential slowdown in growth.  \n- A small **7 %** offered mixed or conditional views, noting possible short‑term drawbacks but long‑term gains, or acknowledging both positive and negative aspects.  \n- Only a single comment was effectively neutral, suggesting the policy had little immediate impact.\n\nThe dominant concerns revolve around rising prices for consumers, the likelihood of companies shifting production abroad, and the risk of strained international relationships. Positive remarks tend to focus on tariff revenue, protection of certain domestic sectors, and the promise of a more self‑sufficient economy. Overall, the prevailing perspective is that the tariff policy is expected to hurt the U.S. economy and society more than it helps.",
