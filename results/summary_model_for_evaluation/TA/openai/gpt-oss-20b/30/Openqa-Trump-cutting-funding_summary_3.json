    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly rejects the proposed cuts to academic funding.  \n- **Majority viewpoint (≈ 80 %)**: Cutting funds is seen as a threat to education, research, and the country’s long‑term competitiveness. Commenters repeatedly cite the role of schools as a foundation for society, the importance of research for innovation and public health, and the risk that students, teachers, and researchers will be deprived of resources or will leave the U.S. for better opportunities.  \n- **Small minority (≈ 10 %)**: A few participants argue that the cuts are justified—either to reduce perceived waste or to counter what they view as left‑leaning bias in academia.  \n- **Neutral/undecided (≈ 10 %)**: A handful of comments express a lack of knowledge or a need for more detail before forming an opinion.\n\nKey themes that recur across the comments include:  \n1. **Education as a societal pillar** – without solid funding, future generations and the nation’s prosperity are jeopardized.  \n2. **Research and innovation** – funding cuts could halt breakthroughs in fields such as medicine and technology, harming national competitiveness.  \n3. **Equity and access** – many note that cuts disproportionately hurt students who cannot afford college and could widen existing inequalities.  \n4. **Political ideology** – a minority frames the debate in terms of ideological battles, labeling the cuts as “Marxist,” “left‑leaning,” or “authoritarian.”  \n\nOverall, the consensus is that the policy is ill‑timed and likely to produce lasting negative consequences for the U.S. educational landscape and its global standing.",
