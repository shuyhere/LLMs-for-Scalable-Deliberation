    "main_points": "The comments reveal a strong split around the tipping practice.  \n- **Majority sentiment** leans toward eliminating or limiting mandatory tipping. Participants frequently cite the pressure it places on customers, the discomfort of being asked to tip for minimal or no service, and the perception that the system encourages employers to pay workers below a livable wage.  \n- **Living wage advocacy** is a common theme: many respondents call for a guaranteed minimum or livable wage for service‑sector employees, arguing that this would make tips optional and less exploitative.  \n- **Quality‑based tipping** remains popular among a minority who support tipping as a reward for exceptional service. These commenters emphasize that tips should reflect the quality of service rather than be a default requirement.  \n- **Systemic concerns** include the proliferation of tipping prompts in new point‑of‑sale technologies, the potential for manipulation of tip amounts, and the lack of transparency about how tips are distributed among staff.  \n- **Alternative proposals** appear in a few responses: fixed‑amount or percentage caps, automatic service charges, or a hybrid approach that keeps tipping optional while ensuring staff receive a fair base pay.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a consensus that the current tipping system is over‑extended and often unfair, with many participants advocating for a shift toward livable wages and optional, quality‑based tipping rather than a mandatory, ubiquitous practice.",
