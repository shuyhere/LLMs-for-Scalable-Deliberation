    "main_points": "The discussion reflects a strong consensus that the current tipping model in the United States is problematic.  \n- **Wage concerns**: A large portion of respondents argue that tipped workers receive insufficient base pay and that a living wage (or a guaranteed minimum wage) would eliminate the need for tips.  \n- **Systemic issues**: Many note that the tipping practice is enforced by technology (e.g., tablet POS prompts) and that it feels forced or mandatory, leading to uncomfortable situations for customers.  \n- **Quality‑based tipping**: A minority advocate keeping tipping but only for exceptional service, suggesting mechanisms such as a “no tip” option, a fixed or standard tip amount, or a service‑charge that replaces discretionary tips.  \n- **Alternatives and reforms**: Suggestions include a compulsory service charge, better communication of service quality before a tip is requested, or a shift to a European‑style inclusive pricing model where tips are not expected.  \n- **Attitudes toward tipping**: While some participants still tip out of gratitude, they emphasize that tipping should be voluntary and tied to real service rather than a default expectation.\n\nOverall, the comments indicate a desire for a more transparent, fair compensation system that reduces or eliminates the reliance on customer tips while still allowing for recognition of exceptional service.",
