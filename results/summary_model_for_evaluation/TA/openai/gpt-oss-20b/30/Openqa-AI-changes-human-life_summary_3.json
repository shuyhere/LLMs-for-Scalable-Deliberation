    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA large majority of respondents view AI as a powerful catalyst for increased productivity and ease in everyday tasks. 77 % of the comments highlight benefits such as faster research, streamlined writing, time‑saving for routine work, and creative assistance (e.g., art, design, and brainstorming). Many also note that AI helps them learn new subjects, improve language skills, and manage personal projects more efficiently.\n\nA smaller portion (16 %) expresses concerns. These focus on privacy (the amount of data AI collects), job security, misinformation, and a sense of being watched or judged. A handful of participants (6 %) feel the impact is mixed, citing both convenience and privacy or accuracy issues.\n\nCommon threads across the responses include:\n\n- **Productivity & Time Management**: AI enables quick summarization, drafting, and organization of information that would otherwise require extensive manual effort.  \n- **Learning & Knowledge Acquisition**: Users appreciate AI’s role as a “search engine” that can explain complex topics and provide instant references.  \n- **Creative Support**: Several comments mention AI’s help with writing, photo editing, and artistic expression.  \n- **Practical Everyday Use**: From planning events to voice‑dictation correction, many find AI useful in daily routines.  \n- **Anxiety & Trust**: A minority feel uneasy about AI’s pervasive presence, fearing loss of trust in others and potential misuse of personal data.\n\nIn sum, AI is largely perceived as a beneficial assistant that enhances efficiency and learning, while a minority remain cautious about its broader societal and personal implications.",
