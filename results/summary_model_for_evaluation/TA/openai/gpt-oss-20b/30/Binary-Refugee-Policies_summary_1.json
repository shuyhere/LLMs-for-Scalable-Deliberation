    "main_points": "Overall, a strong majority of respondents view the United States as having a moral and practical obligation to accept refugees fleeing war and persecution.  \n- **Supportive views (≈ 80 %)** overwhelmingly favor welcoming refugees, often adding that the policy should be tempered with thorough vetting, clear limits, and integration support.  These comments highlight humanitarian duty, the right to safety, and the potential benefits of cultural diversity and population balance.  \n- **Opposing views (≈ 17 %)** argue that the U.S. should focus on its own citizens first, citing fiscal strain, economic impact, and resource shortages.  They also raise concerns that refugees could compete for limited public services.  \n- **Conditional or hesitant perspectives (≈ 3 %)** express uncertainty or a “fence‑between” stance, insisting on strict eligibility criteria and procedural safeguards before any acceptance.\n\nKey themes that recur across the comments include:  \n\n| Theme | What it means | How often it appears |\n|-------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Humanitarian responsibility** | Refugees deserve safety and a chance to rebuild | Most supportive comments |\n| **Vetting and security** | Need to screen for criminal background and ensure public safety | Frequently mentioned among supporters |\n| **Resource and economic impact** | Concerns about strain on social services, healthcare, and the workforce | Common in opposition |\n| **Cultural enrichment** | Diversity can strengthen the nation | Highlighted by several supporters |\n| **National focus** | Priority should be given to U.S. citizens | Main point of opposition |\n\nIn sum, while the majority see acceptance of refugees as a positive and necessary action, a significant minority emphasize national capacity and security, and a small fraction call for balanced, carefully regulated policies.",
