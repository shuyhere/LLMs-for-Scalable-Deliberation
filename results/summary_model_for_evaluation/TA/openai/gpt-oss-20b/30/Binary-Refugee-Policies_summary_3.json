    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Majority Support (≈ 83 %)**  \n  Most comments affirm that the United States should accept refugees fleeing war, persecution, or life‑threatening conditions.  Supporters emphasize humanitarian duty, the right to safety, and the moral legacy of American freedom, while also calling for **thorough vetting** and **balanced resource allocation** to protect both refugees and citizens.\n\n- **Key Supporting Themes**  \n  1. **Humanitarian Compassion** – Refugees are viewed as victims who deserve help and a chance to rebuild.  \n  2. **Rights & Solidarity** – Accepting refugees aligns with global human‑rights norms and promotes cultural diversity.  \n  3. **Practical Benefits** – Some note that refugees can relieve urban crowding, strengthen rural economies, and bring new skills.  \n  4. **Conditional Acceptance** – Many stress limits on numbers, strict security checks, and ensuring that domestic needs are met first.\n\n- **Opposition (≈ 17 %)**  \n  A minority argue that refugee intake strains public resources, increases government expenditure, or risks national security.  Some express concern that the U.S. is already indebted and should focus on its own citizens before extending aid abroad.\n\n- **Neutral/On‑the‑Fence (≈ 3 %)**  \n  A few comments remain ambivalent, acknowledging the moral imperative while also highlighting uncertainty about capacity and policy limits.\n\n- **Recurring Caveats**  \n  - **Vetting and Security** – Nearly all supporters add that refugees must be screened for criminal background or extremist ties.  \n  - **Resource Management** – Concerns about healthcare, housing, education, and employment for both refugees and existing residents appear in many comments.  \n  - **Economic Impact** – The effect on the U.S. economy is a common point of debate, with supporters arguing that refugees can ultimately contribute economically, while opponents warn of immediate costs.\n\nIn sum, the discussion leans strongly toward welcoming refugees, tempered by a consensus that robust screening, practical limits, and careful resource planning are essential.",
