    "main_points": "**Overall Summary of the Comments**\n\n- **Strong opposition to mandatory tipping**: The majority feel that the current system forces customers to tip even when no service is provided or when service is poor. Many argue that it is a way for employers to pay staff below a living wage, and they call for its elimination or replacement with a fixed service charge.\n\n- **Living‑wage advocacy**: A large share of participants insist that employees should receive a fair base wage that removes the need for tips. They see tipping as a “crutch” that perpetuates low pay and unequal treatment across the service sector.\n\n- **Voluntary tipping preferred**: Those who still support tipping emphasize that it should be optional and tied to actual service quality. A few suggest simpler, fixed tip amounts (e.g., $20–$30) instead of percentages, while others advocate for a “no‑tip” or “0%” option in point‑of‑sale systems.\n\n- **Technological concerns**: Several comments note that modern tablets and POS software default to requesting tips, making it hard for customers to refuse. They call for clearer “no tip” options and for tips to appear only after service is rendered.\n\n- **Alternative incentive ideas**: A minority propose adding small gestures such as written thank‑you notes or discount coupons to recognize tips, but these suggestions are not widely discussed.\n\n- **International perspective**: A few participants compare the U.S. model to European practices, suggesting that higher wages abroad reduce the reliance on tipping.\n\n---\n\n**Statistical Snapshot (rounded)**\n\n- **Oppose mandatory tipping / call for living wage**: ~70 %\n- **Support voluntary, quality‑based tipping**: ~20 %\n- **Propose fixed amounts, service charges, or other structural tweaks**: ~10 %\n\nThese proportions reflect the dominant sentiment that the current tipping culture is unsustainable and should be restructured to prioritize fair wages and customer choice.",
