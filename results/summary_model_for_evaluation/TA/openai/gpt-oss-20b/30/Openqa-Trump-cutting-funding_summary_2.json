    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the proposed cuts to academic funding as harmful.  \n- **About 73 %** of respondents argue that the reductions would hurt students, teachers, and research, weaken innovation, and damage the country’s long‑term competitiveness.  \n- **Around 13 %** offer a political justification, citing the perceived left‑leaning nature of universities or suggesting that the cuts are a strategic move to control the public.  \n- **The remaining 13 %** express uncertainty or neutrality, noting a lack of information or suggesting that a balance could be found.\n\nKey concerns that recur across the discussion include:\n- **Foundational role of education**: many see schooling as the bedrock of all professions and warn that funding cuts could set society up for failure.  \n- **Impact on research and innovation**: several comments highlight the risk of losing breakthroughs in fields such as medicine and technology.  \n- **Future competitiveness**: fears that diminished funding will make U.S. institutions less attractive to talent and could lead scholars to seek opportunities abroad.  \n- **Political framing**: a minority frames the cuts as an authoritarian tactic or a deliberate attempt to suppress independent thought.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that the cuts are short‑sighted and detrimental, with a small contingent arguing for a more nuanced or politically motivated rationale.",
