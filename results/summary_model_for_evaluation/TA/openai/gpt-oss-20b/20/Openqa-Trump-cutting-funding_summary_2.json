They view education as foundational, essential for innovation, and a safeguard against long‑term decline.\n\n- **Justification for reductions**:  \n  Roughly **10 %** argue that some cuts can be warranted, often citing concerns about “Marxist” or “left‑leaning” politics in academia or suggesting that the administration has alternative solutions.\n\n- **Neutral or uncertain**:  \n  A small portion (**5 %**) express a need for more information before forming an opinion or claim ignorance of the details.\n\n- **Critical or strongly opposed**:  \n  **20 %** directly criticize the cuts, labeling the policy as authoritarian, foolish, or harmful to national security and public welfare.\n\nIn sum, the majority view the proposed reductions as detrimental to education, research, and the nation’s future, while a minority sees potential justification or requires more details before deciding.",
