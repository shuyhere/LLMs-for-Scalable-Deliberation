    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly suggest that the current tipping practice is problematic and should be re‑thought.  \n- **Majority view**: Tipping feels forced or mandatory, especially in the U.S., and is a symptom of employers paying lower wages.  \n- **Common proposals**:  \n  - **Eliminate or make tipping optional**: Several respondents advocate removing the tipping menu altogether or replacing it with a fixed service charge.  \n  - **Pay a livable wage**: A large share argue that workers should receive a fair hourly wage, reducing reliance on tips.  \n  - **Recognize or reward tipping**: A few suggest giving customers a tangible thank‑you (note, coupon, etc.) or standardising tip amounts rather than using percentages.  \n- **Other points**:  \n  - Some comments note that tipping is acceptable when it is a genuine expression of gratitude, but should not be implied or pressured.  \n  - A few respondents reference European models where tipping is less central.  \n- **Overall sentiment**: The prevailing tone is critical of the existing tipping system and supportive of reforms that either remove mandatory tipping or shift the financial burden onto employers through livable wages or fixed service charges.",
