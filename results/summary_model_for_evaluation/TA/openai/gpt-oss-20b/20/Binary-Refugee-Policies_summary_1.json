    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA strong majority of respondents—roughly **70 %**—express support for the U.S. accepting refugees fleeing war, persecution, or life‑threatening situations.  Most of these supporters emphasize that the policy should be coupled with **rigorous vetting** and **clear limits** on numbers so that the needs of existing citizens are not unduly compromised.  Many also highlight the humanitarian imperative, the potential for cultural enrichment, and the moral duty to help those in crisis.\n\nAbout **15 %** of the comments voice outright opposition, arguing that the country’s debt, strained public services, and the perceived competition for resources make it impractical to take in more refugees at present.  A similar portion—another **15 %**—offers a conditional stance: they support the idea in principle but insist on stringent background checks, integration programs, or a focus on rural areas where populations are lower.\n\nIn short, the prevailing view is pro‑refugee but tempered by concerns about **resource allocation, security, and the need for a balanced approach** that protects both newcomers and current residents.",
