    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\nA wide range of views is expressed, but the dominant tone is **critical of the proposed cuts to academic funding**.  \n- **Impact on students and research**: The majority of comments highlight how reduced funds would hurt students—especially those who cannot afford higher education—and undermine research that drives innovation and long‑term national competitiveness.  \n- **Future prospects**: Many respondents point out that education is a foundational element for a healthy economy, and cutting support threatens the development of future talent and the integrity of institutions.  \n- **Political framing**: A minority frame the cuts as a response to perceived “left‑leaning” or “marxist” influences in academia, suggesting a political motive behind the budget decisions.  \n- **Concerns about authoritarianism**: A few comments link the policy to authoritarian tendencies, warning that it could erode independent thinking and increase state control.  \n- **Calls for balance**: A small portion of respondents acknowledge the need for fiscal prudence but argue that cuts should be moderate and that savings should not come at the expense of educational quality.  \n- **Uncertainty or lack of knowledge**: A few participants admit they lack sufficient information to form an opinion, or they defer to the administration’s reasoning.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward the view that cutting academic funding is detrimental to students, research, and the nation’s future, with a minority defending it on ideological or budgetary grounds.",
