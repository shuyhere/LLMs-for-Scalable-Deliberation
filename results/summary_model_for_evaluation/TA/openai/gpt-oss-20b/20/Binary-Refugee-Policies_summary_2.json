    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance:** About three‑quarters of respondents view accepting refugees fleeing war or persecution positively, while roughly a quarter express concerns that outweigh the benefits.  \n- **Humanitarian motivation:** The majority emphasize the moral duty to help people escaping life‑threatening situations, citing compassion, human rights, and the historical precedent of the United States as a refuge.  \n- **Conditions for acceptance:** Most supporters call for rigorous vetting, clear criteria for refugee status, and limits on numbers to protect national resources and public services.  \n- **Economic and resource concerns:** A notable minority argue that the country’s debt, existing social needs, and potential strain on infrastructure make additional refugees problematic.  \n- **Potential benefits highlighted:** Some comments note that refugees can relieve urban congestion, enrich cultural diversity, and even stimulate rural economic growth if integrated thoughtfully.  \n\nOverall, the discussion balances a strong humanitarian inclination with pragmatic considerations about security, resources, and the capacity to integrate newcomers responsibly.",
