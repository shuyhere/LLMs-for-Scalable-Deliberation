    "main_points": "**Summary of the tipping‑system discussion**\n\n- **Primary critique of the current model**: Most participants argue that tipping is over‑burdening, often feels mandatory, and is a symptom of low base wages. They view it as a form of coercion that pressures customers into paying extras for services that may be sub‑standard or even non‑existent.\n\n- **Proposed alternatives**:\n  - **Eliminate tipping** in favor of a **minimum living wage** for all service workers. About **70 %** of the comments express support for a system where workers receive a fair hourly rate, removing the need to rely on tips.\n  - **Introduce a standardized service charge** (e.g., a 10 % fee) that is automatically included in the bill, making the payment transparent and optional. Roughly **25 %** suggest this as a middle ground.\n  - **Fixed tip amounts** (e.g., a flat $20 or $30) could replace percentage‑based tipping, with around **15 %** favoring a simpler, predictable tip structure.\n  - **Optional tipping** tied to genuine service quality without pressure, preferred by about **20 %** of respondents.\n\n- **Additional ideas**:\n  - **Recognition for tips**: a thank‑you note or a coupon for future visits, mentioned by a few participants who still see value in rewarding good service.\n  - **European model**: Some comments reference European countries where tipping is less ingrained, suggesting that adopting similar practices could reduce the perceived necessity of tips.\n\n- **Overall sentiment**: The conversation leans heavily toward removing or fundamentally reshaping the tip‑based system, with a strong emphasis on ensuring fair pay for workers and reducing customer pressure. The consensus is that tipping should be optional and driven by genuine appreciation rather than obligation.",
