    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the proposed cuts to academic funding as harmful.  \n- **Impact on students and educators**: Most respondents fear that reduced resources will lower the quality of learning, limit research opportunities, and ultimately weaken the country’s long‑term competitiveness.  \n- **Economic and national‑security concerns**: A large share of the comments warn that cutting funding could hinder innovation, push researchers abroad, and diminish the U.S.’s standing in science and technology.  \n- **Political framing**: Several comments tie the decision to perceived political motives—either labeling it as a “left‑leaning” or “authoritarian” tactic, or as a strategy to keep the populace uneducated and easier to control.  \n- **Calls for balance**: A minority of responses suggest that while wasteful spending should be trimmed, a complete or steep cut is unacceptable; they advocate for a more measured approach that preserves essential educational and research functions.  \n- **Uncertainty or lack of knowledge**: A few participants expressed that they did not have enough information to form an opinion, and one commented that they would need details before deciding.  \n\nOverall, roughly **80 % of the comments** express concern or opposition to the funding cuts, while about **10 %** either remain neutral or highlight the need for more information, and the remaining **10 %** discuss possible justifications or political contexts. The dominant sentiment is that the cuts pose a threat to education quality, innovation, and national prosperity.",
