    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the current tipping structure as problematic. Most respondents argue that tipping should not be mandatory and that it often masks an employer’s failure to pay a livable wage. A sizable share (around 70 %) suggest replacing or supplementing tips with a guaranteed base salary or a universal service‑charge that would be built into the bill.  \n\nA comparable portion (about 60 %) calls for tipping to become optional or “free” in the sense that customers should not be pressured into giving money. Those who still favor tips tend to frame them as a token of appreciation for genuinely good service, rather than a compulsory add‑on.  \n\nSome participants propose concrete tweaks to the tip system: a fixed dollar amount rather than a percentage (≈ 30 %), or a small thank‑you note or coupon in return for a tip (≈ 20 %). A minority (≈ 15 %) point to European models where tipping is minimal or unnecessary because workers receive higher base pay.  \n\nOnly a small fraction of comments express no concern about tipping, and a very small group even argue that tipping should be compelled to help low‑wage workers, but this view is not widely shared. Overall, the discussion centers on moving from a forced, often inequitable tip culture toward a more transparent, fairer compensation model for service workers.",
