    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly show that people find AI to be a useful helper that speeds up daily work, simplifies research, and opens new creative possibilities.  \n- **Productivity and efficiency** are the most common positive themes. Respondents describe using AI to draft documents, plan events, correct text, and perform routine or complex searches in a fraction of the time, which gives them more free or “creative” time.  \n- **Learning and information access** also rank high. Several participants note that AI has made it easier to understand technical subjects, gather summaries, and keep up-to-date with information that would otherwise require extensive searching.  \n- **Creative support**—especially for art and writing—appears in a handful of comments, where users feel AI helps them express ideas they previously struggled with.  \n\nA minority of respondents voice concerns that temper their enthusiasm.  \n- **Privacy and data security** are mentioned in a few comments, with worries about personal information being captured or used without consent.  \n- **Trust and authenticity** issues surface when users feel less confident in others’ work or become wary of AI’s influence on creative outputs.  \n- **Job‑security anxiety** is raised by one comment that fears AI could ultimately replace human roles.  \n\nOverall, roughly two‑thirds of the comments are positive, about one‑fifth are neutral or mixed, and around one‑seventh express significant reservations. The prevailing sentiment is that AI is a powerful tool that enhances both day‑to‑day tasks and broader learning or creative endeavors, while a smaller group remains cautious about its broader societal and personal implications.",
