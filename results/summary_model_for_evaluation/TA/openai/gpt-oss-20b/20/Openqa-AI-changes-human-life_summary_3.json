About **70 %** of the comments highlight gains in productivity, easier research, and a smoother flow of day‑to‑day tasks. A significant share (~**20 %**) describes AI as a useful, optional tool that augments but does not transform their lives, noting the need for fact‑checking and occasional inaccuracies. The remaining portion (~**10 %**) expresses concerns—ranging from privacy and job security to increased scepticism toward others’ work and the potential for AI to erode trust. Overall, while the majority celebrate AI’s convenience and creativity‑boosting features, a minority remain cautious about its broader social and ethical implications.",
