    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\n- **Position on enforcement**: Fifty‑percent of the comments favor mandatory vaccination and quarantine measures, often citing the protection of public health, herd immunity, and the need to curb disease spread.  \n- **Conditional support**: Fifteen‑percent see the idea as acceptable only when an epidemic is truly severe and when the vaccines have proven safety and efficacy.  \n- **Opposition**: Thirty‑five‑percent reject mandates, arguing that they infringe on personal choice, raise safety concerns, or that the government’s record is insufficient.\n\n**Common Themes**\n\n| Theme | What it reflects |\n|-------|------------------|\n| **Public health priority** | Many view enforcement as essential for stopping outbreaks and saving lives. |\n| **Individual rights** | Opponents emphasize bodily autonomy and the right to choose medical interventions. |\n| **Evidence & safety** | Conditional supporters and some opponents stress the need for long‑term data and proven vaccine safety before mandates are justified. |\n| **Severity threshold** | A recurring condition is that measures should only be applied when an epidemic threatens national survival or causes widespread harm. |\n| **Trust in government** | Some comments criticize past government responses (e.g., COVID‑19) as a reason to limit its power, while others trust that the state can act responsibly when the stakes are high. |\n| **Herd immunity and community welfare** | Supporters frame mandates as a collective responsibility to protect vulnerable populations and maintain societal functioning. |\n\nThese perspectives illustrate a debate that balances the collective benefit of disease control against individual freedoms, with careful attention to the timing, evidence, and perceived government competence.",
