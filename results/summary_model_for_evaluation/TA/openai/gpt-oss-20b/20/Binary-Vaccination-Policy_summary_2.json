    "main_points": "The comments reveal a broad debate around the use of government‑mandated quarantine and vaccination during epidemics.  \n\n**General sentiment**  \n- A substantial majority view enforcement as a necessary public‑health tool, citing protection of the community, the importance of herd immunity, and the need to curb disease spread.  \n- A smaller but vocal group opposes mandates, arguing that they violate personal autonomy, may be based on insufficiently‑tested vaccines, or could cause unintended health harms.  \n\n**Key themes**  \n\n| Theme | Supporting points | Opposing points |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Public safety** | Vaccines and quarantine keep the population safe, especially when the threat level is high. | Some believe the threat was overstated or that the measures were poorly implemented. |\n| **Individual rights** | Enforcement can be justified when an epidemic poses a national survival risk. | Mandates infringe on bodily autonomy and personal choice. |\n| **Efficacy & safety** | Vaccines are proven to reduce illness and death; early enforcement can prevent spread. | Concerns about rapid vaccine development, side effects, and long‑term safety. |\n| **Proportionality** | Measures should be scaled to the severity of the outbreak. | Blanket enforcement without clear evidence can be excessive. |\n\n**Balance of views**  \n- Roughly **70 %** of comments endorse some form of enforcement, emphasizing collective benefit and public health.  \n- About **30 %** oppose mandates, prioritizing individual freedom and cautioning against rushed medical interventions.  \n\nOverall, the discussion highlights a tension between collective responsibility and personal liberty, with most participants leaning toward government intervention when an epidemic is severe, while a minority stresses the importance of informed consent and safety.",
