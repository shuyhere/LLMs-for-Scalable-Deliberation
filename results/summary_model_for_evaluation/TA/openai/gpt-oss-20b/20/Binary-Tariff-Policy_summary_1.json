    "main_points": "**Overall assessment**\n\n- **Predominant view:** The majority of respondents anticipate a **negative impact** of the current tariff policy on the U.S. economy.  \n- **Positive outlook:** A minority (about a quarter of the comments) argue that the tariffs will ultimately strengthen the economy by protecting domestic industries, raising federal revenue, or encouraging “buy‑American” behavior.  \n- **Mixed or nuanced perspective:** A small fraction acknowledge short‑term costs but expect long‑term benefits, or note that the effects will differ across sectors.\n\n**Common themes**\n\n| Theme | What respondents say | Approx. share |\n|-------|----------------------|---------------|\n| **Higher consumer prices / inflation** | Tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, which businesses pass on to consumers. | 70 % |\n| **Impact on small businesses** | Small firms feel the burden most acutely, fearing reduced competitiveness. | 25 % |\n| **Trade relationships** | Tariffs strain ties with key partners (e.g., China) and risk retaliation. | 20 % |\n| **Domestic industry protection** | Some see tariffs as a tool to shield U.S. manufacturers and create jobs. | 15 % |\n| **Long‑term vs short‑term effects** | A few expect initial pain but eventual stabilization or growth. | 10 % |\n| **Government revenue** | A handful note increased tax receipts as a benefit. | 8 % |\n\n**Key take‑aways**\n\n- The prevailing concern is that the tariffs will **raise living costs** for ordinary Americans and **hurt small‑ and medium‑sized enterprises**.  \n- A minority view the policy as a necessary step toward **economic self‑reliance** and **job creation**, especially if the tariffs become permanent.  \n- A small group points out that while there may be **short‑term disruptions**, the **long‑term trajectory could be positive** if the policy is sustained and accompanied by complementary measures.\n\nOverall, the discourse leans strongly toward a **negative assessment** of the tariff policy’s current economic effects, with optimism tempered by realistic concerns about costs and trade dynamics.",
