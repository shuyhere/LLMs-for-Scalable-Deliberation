Many participants appreciate the entertainment value, the ability to share useful products, and the role influencers play in shaping trends and delivering information that may not appear in traditional media. They also note the profession’s growth during the pandemic and its potential to democratise content creation.  \n- **Critical views (≈31 %)** focus on authenticity, oversaturation, and the risk of spreading misinformation or unrealistic success stories. Concerns are raised about the pressure to constantly chase trends, the negative influence of “outlandish” behaviour to attract views, and the possible erosion of genuine communication among audiences.  \n- **Neutral or balanced comments (≈14 %)** acknowledge influencers as part of the broader entertainment ecosystem, recognizing both their benefits and the challenges they pose. These participants stress the need for responsible behaviour and transparency while acknowledging that the profession is a natural evolution of media consumption.\n\nCollectively, the conversation underscores that while many see influencers as an exciting and valuable addition to the digital landscape, a significant minority question the authenticity, sustainability, and societal impact of this emerging profession.",
