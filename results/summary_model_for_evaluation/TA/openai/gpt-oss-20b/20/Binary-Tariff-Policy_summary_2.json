    "main_points": "**Overall sentiment about the tariff policy**\n\n- **Negative**: About **57 %** of the comments view the tariffs as a net drag on the U.S. economy, citing higher consumer prices, hurt to small businesses, strained trade relations, and limited long‑term benefits.  \n- **Positive**: Roughly **29 %** see the tariffs as a win, arguing that they bring needed revenue, protect domestic industries, and help the U.S. recover from past deficits.  \n- **Mixed/uncertain**: Around **14 %** acknowledge short‑term pain but expect eventual gains, or note that the net effect depends on other policies and global responses.\n\n**Key themes**\n\n- **Price pressure** tops the list of concerns: many respondents point to rising costs for consumers and businesses.  \n- **Industry protection** is frequently mentioned as a potential upside, though it is often framed as limited or temporary.  \n- **Trade relationships**—especially with China—are seen as a significant downside, with worries that tariffs erode diplomatic goodwill and prompt retaliatory moves.  \n- **Long‑term outlook** varies: some participants believe the benefits will accrue over time, while others see little to no upside even after the initial adjustment period.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward a negative assessment of the tariff policy, with a minority confident that the measures will ultimately strengthen the U.S. economy.",
