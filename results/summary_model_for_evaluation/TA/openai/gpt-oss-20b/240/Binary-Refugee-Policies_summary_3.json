These respondents often mention the need for thorough vetting, integration plans, and ensuring that refugees do not compete with citizens for resources.\n\n- **Opposition or hesitation** – Around 10 % of the comments oppose or are wary of expanding refugee intake. Their concerns focus on economic strain, national security risks, the already‑burdened immigration system, or the belief that domestic problems should be addressed first.\n\n- **Common themes across the spectrum**  \n  - *Humanitarian concern* and *moral responsibility* appear in nearly all supportive comments.  \n  - *Economic and resource constraints* are frequently cited by those who are conditional or opposed.  \n  - *Security and vetting* serve as a bridge between the supportive and cautious camps.  \n  - *National identity and immigration heritage* are invoked by many who see refugees as part of America’s founding narrative.\n\nOverall, the discussion leans heavily toward welcoming refugees, with a significant portion of respondents seeking balanced approaches that protect both newcomers and existing citizens.",
