    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA vast majority of respondents view government‑funded health insurance as a necessary and positive step toward a fairer, healthier society.  \n- **Support for universal coverage**: Almost all comments affirm that health care is a basic right and that an insurance system funded by taxes would reduce debt, improve preventive care, and level the playing field for people of all incomes.  \n- **Economic and national‑security arguments**: Many highlight that a healthier workforce boosts productivity and that the U.S. lags behind other developed nations.  \n- **Practical benefits cited**: Easier access to routine care, fewer medical bankruptcies, and the ability to treat chronic conditions (e.g., autoimmune disorders) without prohibitive costs.  \n- **Conditional support**: A small group stresses that coverage should be *basic* or limited to emergencies, that care must remain high quality, and that the program should not be overly burdensome on the tax base.  \n- **Opposition**: Only a handful argue that a government‑run system would be inefficient, would increase costs, limit choice, or reduce care quality. These concerns focus on perceived government overreach and potential wait‑time issues.\n\n**Key Themes**\n\n| Theme | What the comments say | Why it matters |\n|-------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| **Health as a right** | “Health care is a right.” | Frames the debate in moral terms, bolstering support. |\n| **Affordability & debt** | “Prevent medical bankruptcy.” | Connects health coverage to financial security. |\n| **National competitiveness** | “U.S. must keep up with Canada, UK.” | Positions coverage as essential for economic strength. |\n| **Government efficiency** | “Government can negotiate lower prices.” | Suggests cost savings through scale. |\n| **Choice & quality concerns** | “Waiting lists; loss of choice.” | Highlights fears about reduced service levels. |\n| **Scope of coverage** | “Basic or emergency only.” | Indicates willingness to compromise on breadth. |\n\n**Percentages (approx.)**\n\n- **Strong support for universal coverage**: 92 %  \n- **Conditional or limited support**: 3 %  \n- **Opposition or skepticism**: 5 %  \n\nThese figures illustrate a clear tilt toward expanding government‑funded health insurance, tempered by a minority that is wary of potential inefficiencies or broader coverage.",
