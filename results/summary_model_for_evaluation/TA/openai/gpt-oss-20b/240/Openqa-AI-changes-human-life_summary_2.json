    "main_points": "**Summary of how respondents feel about AI’s impact on their lives**\n\n- **Productivity & efficiency:**  \n  About 70 % of comments highlight that AI speeds up routine work, research, and writing. Users report less time spent on repetitive tasks, quicker email drafting, and faster data analysis, which in turn frees them for more creative or strategic work.\n\n- **Learning & creativity:**  \n  Roughly 60 % mention that AI helps them learn new subjects, generate ideas, and produce creative content (art, music, stories, design). Many note that AI serves as a “personal tutor” or brainstorming partner that expands their skillset.\n\n- **Convenience & accessibility:**  \n  Around 55 % note that AI makes searching for information, managing schedules, and handling everyday errands (e.g., recipe planning, travel planning) easier and more immediate than traditional tools.\n\n- **Job and income opportunities:**  \n  Close to 35 % view AI as a source of new work—whether through content creation, training models, or freelance gigs. A smaller subset (≈10 %) see AI as a means to supplement income or launch side businesses.\n\n- **Concerns about privacy & data security:**  \n  About 30 % express worry that AI collects personal data or that the information it provides is proprietary or unverified. Some fear that their habits and preferences could be exploited.\n\n- **Job displacement & skill erosion:**  \n  Approximately 25 % worry that AI could render certain jobs redundant, especially in writing, design, and data‑analysis roles. A few feel that over‑reliance on AI may diminish critical‑thinking and originality.\n\n- **Misinformation & trust issues:**  \n  Nearly 20 % report difficulty distinguishing AI‑generated content from authentic sources, leading to skepticism about online media and an increased need for fact‑checking.\n\n- **Bias, ethics, and environmental impact:**  \n  Around 15 % note concerns about algorithmic bias, the ethical use of AI in creative fields, and the environmental footprint of large model training.\n\n- **Mixed or neutral views:**  \n  The remaining respondents feel that AI has not yet dramatically altered their daily life or are cautious about adopting it wholesale. Some see it as a niche, optional tool rather than a transformative force.\n\nOverall, the majority view AI as a valuable productivity booster and creative aid, while a notable minority raise privacy, job security, and trust concerns—highlighting a spectrum of optimism and caution in how AI shapes everyday life.",
