    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly lean toward welcoming refugees who are fleeing war or persecution, with most respondents framing acceptance as a moral and humanitarian obligation. Around **70 %** of the voices express support, often coupled with a call for **rigorous vetting**, **reasonable limits**, and **adequate resources** to ensure that new arrivals do not unduly strain public services. Many emphasize that refugees should be **clearly verified** as genuine asylum seekers and that the U.S. should balance this duty with the **needs of its own citizens**, noting concerns about economic burden, housing shortages, and security risks.\n\nApproximately **20 %** of the comments oppose expanding refugee intake, citing concerns that current domestic challenges—such as debt, homelessness, and an already crowded immigration system—make it impractical to absorb more newcomers. These voices stress that resources should first address **internal problems** and that the country’s capacity to support refugees is limited.\n\nThe remaining **10 %** of comments remain ambivalent or conditional. They acknowledge the humanitarian imperative but request **strict oversight**, **specialized support programs**, or a **step‑wise approach** that allows the U.S. to gradually increase intake while monitoring outcomes.\n\nKey themes that recur across the spectrum are:\n\n* **Humanitarian duty** – Many affirm that the U.S. has a historical and moral role in protecting people in danger.\n* **Vetting and security** – Concerns about potential criminals or terrorists entering the country are common among both supporters and opponents.\n* **Resource allocation** – Debates focus on whether the U.S. can afford to provide housing, healthcare, education, and employment to newcomers without compromising services for existing residents.\n* **Domestic priorities** – A significant portion of respondents prioritizes addressing internal social and economic issues before expanding refugee admissions.\n* **Balance and proportion** – Supporters often propose caps or selective admissions (e.g., focusing on younger, educated refugees) to mitigate perceived negative impacts.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a consensus that refugees deserve protection, tempered by pragmatic worries about the U.S.’s capacity to accommodate them safely and sustainably.",
