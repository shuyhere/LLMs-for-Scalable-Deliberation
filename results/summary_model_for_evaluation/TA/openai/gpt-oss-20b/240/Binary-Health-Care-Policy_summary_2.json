    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly favor a government‑sponsored basic health‑insurance program.  Roughly 80–85 % of respondents view health coverage as a fundamental right that should be guaranteed to every citizen, regardless of income or employment status.  Those in favor emphasize:\n\n* **Equity and fairness** – the ability to access care should not depend on having a job or sufficient savings.  \n* **Public health benefits** – universal coverage is seen as a way to reduce preventable disease, lower emergency‑room use, and improve overall population health.  \n* **Economic efficiency** – many argue that a single, tax‑funded system would lower administrative costs and drive down the total cost of care over time.  \n* **International comparison** – references to Canada, the UK and other developed nations are used to illustrate that the U.S. can afford, and should adopt, a similar model.  \n\nA smaller but notable minority (around 10–15 %) opposes or is skeptical of a universal scheme.  Their main concerns include:\n\n* **Cost to taxpayers** – fears that the program would be too expensive or would require significant tax increases.  \n* **Government inefficiency** – worries that bureaucratic oversight would reduce quality, slow service, and create long wait times.  \n* **Loss of choice** – some worry that a single plan would limit the ability to choose private insurers or plans that suit individual needs.  \n* **Exclusion of non‑citizens** – a few comments highlight that coverage should be limited to legal residents and not extend to undocumented immigrants.  \n\nA handful of respondents offer a **conditional stance**: they support basic coverage but want it to be limited, tiered, or paired with private options, or they call for reforms to improve the current system before a full transition.\n\nOverall, the sentiment is strongly supportive of a government‑backed health‑insurance safety net, with a minority voice cautioning about fiscal, operational, and policy implications.",
