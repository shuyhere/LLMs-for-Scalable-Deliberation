    "main_points": "The comments reveal a broad consensus that the United States should welcome refugees fleeing war or persecution, but most respondents attach important conditions to that support.  \n\n**Supportive stance (≈70 %)**  \n- **Humanitarian motivation**: Many see accepting refugees as a moral obligation rooted in American history and the nation’s founding values.  \n- **Conditional acceptance**: A large share of supporters call for stringent vetting, background checks, and clear legal processes to prevent abuse of the system.  \n- **Limits and balance**: Several respondents add that the U.S. should set a cap or limit intake, ensuring that domestic needs—such as housing, healthcare, and employment—are not unduly strained.  \n- **Economic and cultural benefits**: Some argue that refugees can contribute to the economy and enrich cultural diversity, framing acceptance as a strategic advantage.\n\n**Opposing stance (≈20 %)**  \n- **Resource constraints**: Opponents emphasize the country’s debt, strained public services, and housing shortages, arguing that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens first.  \n- **Security concerns**: A portion of the comments express fear that refugees may bring crime or terrorism, underscoring the need for tighter security measures.  \n- **Political and civic priorities**: A minority feels that the government should focus on domestic reforms and that current immigration policies are already overburdened.\n\n**Neutral/uncertain stance (≈10 %)**  \n- A small group acknowledges the humanitarian imperative but remains unsure about the feasibility of large‑scale acceptance, citing the need for systemic reforms before expanding refugee intake.\n\n**Key themes across the spectrum**  \n- **Vetting and oversight**: Nearly all respondents—whether supportive or cautious—highlight the necessity of thorough background checks and a robust legal framework.  \n- **Balance with national interests**: Even those who favor acceptance frequently stress that refugee policies must align with the welfare of existing citizens, avoiding negative impacts on employment, public services, or security.  \n- **Historical and moral framing**: The U.S. is repeatedly referenced as a refuge for persecuted peoples, reinforcing the moral narrative that accepting refugees is part of the nation’s identity.\n\nOverall, the discussion shows a strong inclination toward humanitarian action, tempered by realistic concerns about security, resources, and domestic priorities. The prevailing sentiment is that the U.S. should accept refugees, but only under carefully designed, limited, and well‑managed conditions.",
