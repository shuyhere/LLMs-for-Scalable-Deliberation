    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nAcross the comments, viewpoints cluster around three main themes:\n\n| Theme | How respondents expressed it | Rough share of comments |\n|-------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Support for enforcement** | Many participants argued that governments should be able to mandate vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics, citing public‑health, herd immunity, and the need to protect vulnerable populations. | about 55 % |\n| **Conditional or limited support** | A sizable minority agreed that enforcement is warranted only under specific circumstances—e.g., when the disease is highly contagious or when vaccines are proven safe and effective. Some called for transparent, time‑limited mandates and safeguards against abuse. | about 15 % |\n| **Opposition or strong reservations** | Those opposed to mandates emphasized bodily autonomy, distrust of government authority, potential side‑effects, or the risk of authoritarian overreach. A minority supported quarantine but not vaccination, while others rejected both forms of enforcement. | about 30 % |\n\n**Key Points of Consensus and Division**\n\n* **Public‑Health Argument** – Supporters consistently framed mandates as a tool to prevent widespread illness and death, often invoking examples from COVID‑19, measles, and polio.  \n* **Individual Rights** – Opponents highlighted personal freedom, consent, and the right to choose medical interventions, frequently citing the need for informed choice and caution about rapid vaccine rollout.  \n* **Trust in Government** – Where trust was high, respondents were more likely to endorse mandates; low trust correlated with opposition.  \n* **Scope of Authority** – Even among supporters, there was debate over how broad the authority should be, with calls for clear limits, oversight, and a focus on severe epidemics only.  \n\n**Takeaway**\n\nThe discussion reveals a split between those who see government enforcement as a necessary public‑health measure during severe outbreaks and those who view such mandates as an infringement on personal liberty and a potential source of abuse. A notable minority occupies a middle ground, supporting enforcement only under strict conditions and with safeguards.",
