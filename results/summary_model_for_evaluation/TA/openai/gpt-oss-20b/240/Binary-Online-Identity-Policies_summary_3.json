    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation**\n\n- **Overall stance**  \n  Approximately three‑quarters of the comments oppose mandatory real‑name registration on social media, while about one‑quarter support it.  \n\n- **Key concerns of the majority**  \n  - **Privacy and safety**: many fear that requiring real names would expose users to doxxing, stalking, discrimination, and government surveillance.  \n  - **Freedom of expression**: anonymity is seen as essential for vulnerable groups (e.g., activists, victims of domestic abuse, LGBTQ+ youth) to speak openly without retaliation.  \n  - **Data misuse**: there is a strong worry that platforms would exploit personal information for targeted advertising or sell it to third parties.  \n  - **Enforcement issues**: several commentators note that users could still bypass the rule, and that the measure would not effectively reduce harassment or misinformation.  \n\n- **Arguments of the minority**  \n  - **Accountability and safety**: supporters argue that linking accounts to real identities would deter cyberbullying, scams, and illegal activity, and would make it easier to hold offenders accountable.  \n  - **Reducing bots and fake accounts**: a common point is that real‑name registration would cut down on impersonation and automated abuse.  \n  - **Conditional support**: many express a middle ground—requiring real names only on certain platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, professional networks) or as an optional, not compulsory, feature.  \n  - **Transparency and trust**: some believe that knowing who is behind a post would foster a healthier online community.  \n\n- **Common themes across all comments**  \n  - **Balancing act**: almost every perspective calls for a trade‑off between protecting users from harm and preserving privacy.  \n  - **Platform‑specific nuance**: the debate frequently hinges on the nature of the social media service—whether it is primarily for professional networking, casual entertainment, or advocacy.  \n  - **Technological feasibility**: several notes that even with real‑name registration, sophisticated users could still create pseudonymous accounts, questioning the efficacy of the policy.  \n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a tension between the desire for safer, more accountable online spaces and the equally strong value placed on privacy, freedom of expression, and protection from real‑world harm.",
