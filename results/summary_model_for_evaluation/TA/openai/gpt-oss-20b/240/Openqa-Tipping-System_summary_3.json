    "main_points": "**Summary of perspectives on tipping**\n\nAcross the comments, a few clear patterns emerge:\n\n* **Majority favor removing or reducing the role of tips** – A large share of respondents believe that tipping is unnecessary or harmful, arguing that it lets employers under‑pay workers and forces customers into an uncomfortable “extra cost.” They often point to European models where wages are higher and tipping is rare, and propose making tipping optional or eliminating it entirely.\n\n* **Living‑wage advocacy is common** – Many commenters call for employers to raise base pay to a livable level (often citing a $15/hour target) so that workers no longer depend on tips. Those who support this view also view tipping as a bonus for exceptional service rather than a wage supplement.\n\n* **Conditional tipping is preferred** – Those who still support tipping typically want it tied to the quality of service and to specific service roles (e.g., waiters, delivery, or hospitality staff). A significant portion of respondents say tips should be optional, or should only be requested when a person has provided direct, personal service.\n\n* **Technology and payment systems are criticized** – A number of comments criticize modern point‑of‑sale systems that automatically prompt for tips, especially at counters or for simple purchases. Proposals include adding a clear “no tip” option, limiting tip suggestions to a single percentage, or moving the tip into the price of the item.\n\n* **Mixed feelings about mandatory or “service charge” alternatives** – Some respondents suggest replacing tips with a fixed service charge (often around 10 %) or a small flat fee, but many reject any mandatory charge, preferring instead to keep tipping voluntary.\n\n* **Economic concerns for workers** – Several comments highlight that tipped workers often earn less than minimum wage and that tipping creates income volatility. They call for better wage policies, tax reform (e.g., removing tip‑tax exemptions), and clearer sharing of tips among staff.\n\n* **Consumer experience matters** – A recurring theme is that tipping should not feel obligatory or intrusive. People express frustration with being asked to tip for take‑out, coffee, or at grocery stores, and want the choice to tip or not to be respected.\n\n**Overall, the discussion leans strongly toward a tipping system that is optional, tied to quality of service, and supported by fair base wages—while many respondents view the current practice as over‑extended and recommend reforms that reduce reliance on customer‑provided tips.**",
