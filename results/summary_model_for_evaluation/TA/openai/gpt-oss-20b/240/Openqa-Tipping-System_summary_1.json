    "main_points": "**Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Abolition or major reform is the prevailing sentiment.**  \n  Roughly **70 %** of the comments call for either eliminating tipping altogether or replacing it with a flat service charge or a built‑in fee. This group argues that tipping is a convenient way for employers to sidestep paying a living wage, that it places undue pressure on customers, and that it is increasingly forced through electronic payment prompts.\n\n- **Living wages and fair pay are central demands.**  \n  About **60 %** of the voices insist that workers should receive a base salary that meets or exceeds the minimum wage. They see tipping as a temporary band‑aid that keeps employees in a precarious financial position. Many suggest that once workers earn a stable wage, tips could become an optional bonus for exceptional service rather than a necessity.\n\n- **Quality‑based, optional tipping remains popular among a sizable minority.**  \n  Approximately **20 %** of respondents support the traditional tip system but want it to be genuinely optional and tied to the level of service. They favor clear guidelines (e.g., “10 % for good, 15 % for excellent”) and dislike the “default” tip percentages that are often pre‑selected on POS systems.\n\n- **Practical suggestions for change.**  \n  Common proposals include:  \n  - Replacing the tip box with a mandatory service charge or a flat fee that is included in the menu price.  \n  - Introducing a “no‑tip” option on all electronic payment screens.  \n  - Providing explicit information on wage structures and tip distribution, especially in establishments that split tips among staff.  \n  - Limiting tipping to situations where a person provides direct, personalized service (e.g., servers, delivery drivers) and removing it from counter‑service or pickup scenarios.\n\n- **Mixed feelings about the cultural role of tipping.**  \n  A minority view tipping as a meaningful gesture of appreciation and a way to reward good service. They argue for maintaining the practice but with clearer boundaries and less coercive mechanisms. Overall, however, the consensus leans toward reducing or eliminating the dependency on tips in favor of more stable, employer‑provided compensation.",
