    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly express concern that the proposed funding cuts will harm students, researchers, and the broader economy.  \n- **Negative sentiment:** About 90 % of the remarks caution that reduced funding will weaken education, stall research, lower innovation, increase inequality, and make the United States less competitive globally.  \n- **Supportive sentiment:** Roughly 5 % see the cuts as a way to curb waste, protect private institutions, or align resources with priorities that they believe are more important.  \n- **Neutral or uncertain:** The remaining 5 % either request more information, express mixed feelings, or remain undecided, citing a lack of details on what is actually being cut.\n\nCommon themes among the negative responses include:\n\n1. **Academic and research funding is essential for innovation and national security.** Many comments warn that cutting grants will delay medical breakthroughs, technological progress, and basic science discoveries.  \n2. **Students and teachers will suffer.** Several remarks note that reduced money will shrink scholarships, raise class sizes, cut programs, and ultimately lower the quality of education for all, especially for low‑income and marginalized groups.  \n3. **Political motives and authoritarianism are suspected.** A sizable portion of the comments accuse the administration of using funding cuts to suppress dissent, limit diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, and keep the electorate less informed.  \n4. **Economic and workforce impacts.** Several comments predict that a less educated workforce will hurt U.S. competitiveness, increase unemployment, and foster a brain drain to other countries.  \n\nThe few supportive comments frame the cuts as a necessary correction of perceived over‑spending, a focus on fiscal responsibility, or an effort to reduce ideological influence in academia. However, these views are in the minority and are often coupled with concerns about unintended consequences.  \n\nOverall, the consensus is that the funding reductions are detrimental to the nation’s educational, scientific, and economic future, with only a small minority viewing them as beneficial.",
