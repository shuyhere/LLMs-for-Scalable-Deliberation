    "main_points": "**Overall sentiment**\n\n- **Supportive of government enforcement** (≈ 60 % of comments)  \n  *Many respondents see mandatory vaccination and quarantine as essential tools for protecting public health, especially during severe epidemics. The most common arguments are that such measures save lives, achieve herd immunity, and prevent the spread of disease when voluntary compliance is insufficient.*\n\n- **Opposed to government enforcement** (≈ 24 % of comments)  \n  *These comments emphasize individual bodily autonomy, distrust of government motives, and concerns about safety or side‑effects. A minority also raised fears of authoritarian overreach and the potential for abuse of power.*\n\n- **Conditional or nuanced positions** (≈ 16 % of comments)  \n  *A sizable group holds a middle ground: they support enforcement only when the epidemic is truly severe, when vaccines are proven safe, or when the measures are transparent and proportionate. Some accept quarantine but reject compulsory vaccination, while others call for strong public education rather than mandates.*\n\n**Common themes**\n\n| Theme | Representative comment | Majority stance |\n|-------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Public‑health benefit** | “Vaccines save lives and prevent outbreaks.” | Supportive |\n| **Herd immunity / collective safety** | “Mandatory vaccination guarantees herd immunity.” | Supportive |\n| **Bodily autonomy / personal choice** | “People should decide what goes into their body.” | Opposed |\n| **Trust in government / fear of abuse** | “The government has shown it can be oppressive.” | Opposed |\n| **Risk–benefit of vaccines** | “Vaccines were rushed and may have side‑effects.” | Conditional / Opposed |\n| **Quarantine vs. vaccination** | “Quarantine is acceptable; vaccination should be voluntary.” | Conditional |\n| **Severity threshold** | “Mandates only if the disease is very dangerous.” | Conditional |\n| **Transparency & oversight** | “Mandates must be accompanied by clear guidelines and safeguards.” | Conditional |\n\n**Overall takeaway**\n\nWhile a majority of respondents favor government enforcement of vaccination and quarantine during severe epidemics, a significant minority remain against compulsory measures, citing individual rights, mistrust, or concerns about vaccine safety. A noteworthy proportion adopt a conditional stance, supporting mandates only under specific circumstances such as high disease severity, proven vaccine safety, or robust oversight. The debate frequently centers on balancing public health goals against personal liberty and the potential for governmental overreach.",
