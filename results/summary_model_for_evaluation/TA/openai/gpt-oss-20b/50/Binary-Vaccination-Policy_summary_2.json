    "main_points": "The discussion shows a clear split around the idea of government‑led vaccination and quarantine mandates.  \n**Majority view** – About **70 %** of the comments support enforcement, but almost all agree that the measures should be tied to a serious epidemic, proven vaccine safety, and the public‑health benefit of herd immunity.  These respondents stress that the state has a duty to protect citizens when the risk is high, and that mandatory measures are justified when the disease’s spread threatens lives and the economy.  \n\n**Opposition** – Roughly **20 %** argue against mandates.  Their main concerns are individual bodily autonomy, the possibility of adverse vaccine reactions, and a broader distrust of government authority.  Some note that past experiences (e.g., rapid COVID‑19 vaccine rollout) raised safety questions, while others simply reject any coercive policy regardless of the situation.  \n\n**Neutral or conditional positions** – About **10 %** do not take a firm stance.  These comments often call for a balanced approach—allowing choice where possible, or insisting on voluntary participation unless the outbreak reaches a critical threshold.  A few emphasize that enforcement should be limited to quarantine rather than vaccination, or that vaccines should remain optional but widely available.\n\nOverall, the debate centers on balancing public‑health imperatives against individual rights, with the dominant sentiment leaning toward conditional enforcement during severe epidemics.",
