    "main_points": "analysisWe need to summarize comments. We must not mention total number of comments or participants. Use percentages. Let's analyze stance: many are supportive of government enforcement during severe epidemics. Others oppose. Some nuance: support but with conditions. Some say no. We can categorize: support unconditional, support conditional, oppose, some neutral. Compute approximate percentages? Let's roughly count. I'll quickly estimate: total comments maybe around 90? Let's count quickly: I'll enumerate lines: 1 I do not. 2 no because... 3 I support... 4 yes... 5 i support... 6 Yes... 7 Yes... 8 I think it's a good idea... 9 Yes... 10 No I don’t support... 11 As much as... 12 No i do not support... 13 Yes. It's important... 14 Yes, from a science point... 15 No, I don't support... 16 I support governments... 17 I think I do not... 18 No, I do NOT support... 19 I think that the government can and should enforce... 20 I think the government should have the authority... 21 I do support the government having the authority... 22 I support these measures... 23 I do not support the governments authority... 24 No, I do not think anyone should be forced... 25 Yes, I support it... 26 I only support if the vaccination will be optional. 27 I do support the government enforcing... 28 Yes, I fully support... 29 I do not. 30 No, this is because... 31 yes of course... 32 I fully support the government enforcing... 33 No I do not... 34 Yes, because in severe epidemics... 35 I think it’s really important... 36 I support the government having the authority... 37 Yes I think it's important if they believe... 38 I do not support government enforcing... 39 I think the government should have the power... 40 I support the government having the authority... 41 Yes, I do, because it is a choice that can prevent suffering... 42 No. The government has lost credibility... 43 Quarantine in some scenarios. Required vaccination, absolutely not. 44 Yes, I support the government having authority... 45 Yes, it is important to protect the safety... 46 When there's a bad sickness, the government should have power... 47 While I support the government enforcing quarantine... 48 As long as the government is funding... 49 Yes i do absolutely support governments authority... 50 Yes, I do as it can save lives...\n\nSo about 50 comments. Actually 48? Let's count again: I counted 50 lines. So 50. We'll use percentages accordingly. Determine support: unconditional support (lines 3,5,6,7,9,13,14,16,21,22,24? Actually 24 is opposition. 25 is yes, 27 yes, 28 yes, 30 no, 31 yes, 32 yes, 34 yes, 35 yes, 36 yes, 37 yes, 39 yes, 40 yes, 41 yes, 44 yes, 45 yes, 46 yes, 48 yes, 49 yes, 50 yes). Many. Let's count supportive: 3,5,6,7,9,13,14,16,21,22,25,27,28,31,32,34,35,36,37,39,40,44,45,46,48,49,50 = 27? Also 24? No 24 is not. So 27 supportive. Conditional support: 11 (support but only under severe epidemic and effective vaccine), 18 (support quarantine but not force vaccinations), 20 (support but criminal penalties), 29 (only support if vaccination optional?), 38 (support quarantine but not vaccines), 42 (supports but not mandatory?), 43 (quarantine some but required vaccination absolutely not). That's 7. Opposition: 1,2,10,12,15,18? Actually 18 is conditional. 23,24,30,33,42? 42 conditional. 43 not. 48 conditional? 48 says if funding and safe. So opposition: 1,2,10,12,15,23,24,30,33,42? Actually 42 is conditional. 43 not. So 6? Let's count: 1,2,10,12,15,23,24,30,33 = 9. Some others: 41? 41 yes. 47? 47 conditional. 47 says support quarantine but wrong to force vaccine. So that's opposition to vaccine enforcement. So add 47. 48 conditional. So opposition 10. Also 42? 42: \"I do not support government enforcing vaccination and quarantine measures during severe epidemics.\" That's outright opposition. So 10.\n\nNeutral? 20? 20 is supportive but harsh penalties. That's conditional. 26 \"only support if vaccination optional\" is opposition. 47. 48. 20. 31? 31 yes. 32 yes. 36 yes. 37 yes. 38? 38 says government should have the power to enforce quarantine measures. That's support. 39 support. 40 support. 41 yes. 42 conditional? Actually 42: \"I do not support government enforcing vaccination and quarantine measures during severe epidemics.\" That's opposition. 43 \"Quarantine in some scenarios. Required vaccination, absolutely not.\" That's opposition. 44 yes. 45 yes. 46 yes. 48 conditional. 49 yes. 50 yes.\n\nSo supportive unconditional: about 27. Conditional supportive: 7 (including 20,41? Wait 41 unconditional). So 7 conditional. Oppositional: 10. Neutral: maybe none.\n\nThus percentages: Supportive unconditional: 54% (27/50). Conditional supportive: 14% (7/50). Opposing: 20% (10/50). Others? Actually 27+7+10=44. Missing 6. Those 6 maybe neutral/uncertain: 16? Let's double-check missing lines: 18 is conditional. 20 is conditional. 26 is opposition. 27 yes. 28 yes. 31 yes. 32 yes. 34 yes. 35 yes. 36 yes. 37 yes. 38? 38 says government should have power to enforce quarantine but vaccinations help protect. That is supportive. 39 supportive. 40 supportive. 41 yes. 42 opposition. 43 opposition. 44 yes. 45 yes. 46 yes. 47 conditional. 48 conditional. 49 yes. 50 yes. That's all. We accounted. The missing 6 maybe those we didn't classify? Let's list all 50 with classification:\n\n1: no support - opposition\n2: no support - opposition\n3: support unconditional - support\n4: yes - support\n5: support - support\n6: Yes - support\n7: Yes - support\n8: I think it's a good idea - support\n9: Yes - support\n10: No I don’t support - opposition\n11: support but only under severe epidemic and effective - conditional support\n12: No i do not support - opposition\n13: Yes - support\n14: Yes - support\n15: No I don't support - opposition\n16: I support governments - support\n17: I think I do not - opposition\n18: I think government can and should enforce quarantine but not force vaccinations - conditional support? Actually they support quarantine but not vaccination. So they oppose vaccination enforcement. So opposition to vaccination enforcement. But they support partial enforcement. Might classify as conditional support for quarantine only. So moderate support but not vaccine. We'll classify as conditional support for quarantine, but opposition to vaccine enforcement. 19: I think the government should have authority ... penalize - support\n20: I do support the government having the authority - support\n21: I support these measures - support\n22: I do not support the governments authority - opposition\n23: No, I do not think anyone should be forced - opposition\n24: Yes, I support it - support\n25: I only support if vaccination will be optional - opposition\n26: I do support the government enforcing vaccines and quarantine during severe epidemics - support\n27: Yes, I fully support - support\n28: I do not. - opposition\n29: No, this is because... - opposition\n30: yes of course... - support\n31: I fully support - support\n32: No I do not - opposition\n33: Yes, because in severe epidemics... - support\n34: I think it’s really important... - support\n35: I support the government having the authority... - support\n36: Yes I think it's important... - support\n37: I do not support government enforcing vaccination and quarantine... - opposition\n38: I think the government should have the power... - support\n39: I support the government having the authority... - support\n40: Yes, I do, because it is a choice... - support\n41: No. The government has lost credibility... - opposition\n42: Quarantine in some scenarios. Required vaccination, absolutely not. - opposition\n43: Yes, I support the government having authority... - support\n44: Yes, it is important to protect the safety... - support\n45: When there's a bad sickness, the government should have power... - support\n46: While I support the government enforcing quarantine... but wrong to force vaccine - opposition to vaccine enforcement but support quarantine\n47: As long as the government is funding... - support\n48: Yes i do absolutely support governments authority - support\n49: Yes, I do",
