    "main_points": "**Summary**\n\n- **Overall stance**: A large majority—about **70 %**—express support for government‑mandated vaccination and quarantine measures during severe epidemics.  \n- **Conditional support**: Roughly **10 %** of respondents say they would back enforcement only under specific circumstances, such as when the disease is truly severe, when vaccines have proven safety and efficacy, or when the measures are funded and offered free of charge.  \n- **Opposition**: Approximately **20 %** oppose mandatory vaccination or quarantine, citing individual bodily autonomy, concerns over vaccine safety, mistrust of government authority, or the belief that people should make their own health choices.  \n- **Key themes among supporters**:  \n  - Emphasis on protecting public health, preventing widespread illness, and saving lives.  \n  - Reference to herd immunity and the collective good.  \n  - Some highlight the necessity of swift action in the face of a rapidly spreading disease.  \n- **Key concerns among opponents**:  \n  - Fear of infringements on personal liberty and bodily autonomy.  \n  - Skepticism about vaccine safety, long‑term effects, and rapid development timelines.  \n  - Distrust of government motives and past handling of epidemics.  \n- **Nuanced positions**: Many respondents blend support with caution—endorsing enforcement while insisting on transparency, rigorous testing, and the right to refuse if the vaccine’s safety profile is uncertain.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a strong inclination toward collective protection measures, tempered by significant reservations about individual rights and vaccine safety.",
