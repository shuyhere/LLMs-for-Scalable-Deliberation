    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly warns that trimming federal support for schools, universities and research will weaken the nation’s educational foundation and long‑term competitiveness.  \n- **Safety‑net and innovation**: About 85 % of the comments stress that lower funding limits resources for students, hampers faculty research, and could drive promising scholars and projects abroad.  \n- **Future workforce**: Nearly all respondents fear that reduced investment will create skill gaps, slow economic growth, and erode social mobility.  \n- **Political motives**: A sizable share (roughly 15 %) frames the cuts as a deliberate move to suppress “left‑leaning” or “indoctrinating” academia, or to keep the public less informed and more controllable.  \n- **Authoritarian concerns**: Several voices label the policy a classic tactic of authoritarian or fascist regimes, linking funding cuts to a broader strategy of societal control.  \n- **Critiques of waste**: A minority (≈10 %) argue that the federal budget has over‑funded some programs, suggesting that a more efficient allocation—rather than a blanket cut—would be preferable.  \n- **Neutral or uninformed**: A small fraction (≈5 %) either admit they lack enough information to weigh in or express a tentative belief that a re‑balance of spending might be possible.  \n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that the move is short‑sighted and detrimental, with only occasional calls for a more nuanced, efficiency‑driven approach.",
