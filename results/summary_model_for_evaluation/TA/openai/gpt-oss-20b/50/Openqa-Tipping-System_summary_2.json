    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly critique the current U.S. tipping system as burdensome, inconsistent, and a way for employers to underpay staff. About **70 %** of respondents advocate for removing or making tipping optional, or replacing it with a flat service charge or a living‑wage policy that eliminates the need for tips altogether. Many suggest that tips should only be asked for when a clear, personal service is rendered (e.g., sit‑down dining) and that payment systems should make a “no tip” choice obvious or default.  \n\nA smaller portion—roughly **25 %**—expresses support for tipping when service is outstanding, but still calls for reforms such as higher base wages, fixed tip amounts, or clearer guidelines to avoid pressure on customers. A handful of comments highlight successful European or Japanese models where tipping is minimal or nonexistent, and reference the potential benefits of a higher minimum wage or a mandatory service fee.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans strongly toward reducing or eliminating the tipping requirement, while ensuring workers receive fair compensation, and preserving the option for customers to reward exceptional service.",
