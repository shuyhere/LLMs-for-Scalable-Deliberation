    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the current tariff policy as harmful to the U.S. economy.  \n- **Negative assessments** dominate, comprising roughly **80 %** of the responses.  These participants cite higher consumer prices, hurting small businesses, reduced competitiveness, strained international relationships, and a looming recession.  \n- **Positive viewpoints** account for about **15 %**.  Those respondents argue that tariffs can support domestic industries, bring in revenue, and eventually help the country “rise from poverty.”  \n- A small minority—approximately **5 %**—describe the impact as **mixed**, acknowledging both short‑term costs and potential long‑term benefits such as job creation or budget relief.\n\nOverall, the sentiment leans strongly toward the belief that tariffs will create more economic strain than advantage, with concerns about inflation, consumer burden, and international isolation outweighing any perceived gains.",
