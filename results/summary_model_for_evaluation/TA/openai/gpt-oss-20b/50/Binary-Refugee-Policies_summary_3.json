    "main_points": "**Summary of Perspectives on Accepting Refugees**\n\n- **Overall sentiment**  \n  – A large majority view the United States as having a humanitarian duty to accept refugees fleeing war and persecution.  \n  – A smaller group opposes additional intake, citing domestic needs and resource constraints.  \n  – Many comments fall in between, supporting assistance but insisting on strict vetting, limits, and balanced resource allocation.\n\n- **Key themes among supportive comments**  \n  – **Humanitarian obligation**: Refugees are seen as innocent victims who deserve safety and a chance to rebuild.  \n  – **Historical and moral precedent**: The U.S. is portrayed as a nation that itself was founded on the principle of refuge.  \n  – **Positive impact**: Some argue refugees can enrich communities, especially rural areas, and contribute economically.  \n  – **Conditional stance**: Most supporters emphasize the need for thorough background checks, integration programs, and clear limits to avoid strain on public services.\n\n- **Key themes among opposing comments**  \n  – **Domestic priorities**: Concerns that the country cannot afford additional refugees while addressing existing social and economic challenges.  \n  – **Resource competition**: Fear that refugees will compete with native citizens for jobs, housing, and public benefits.  \n  – **Security and vetting**: Some worry that inadequate screening could introduce criminals or security risks.\n\n- **Common caveats**  \n  – **Vetting and integration**: Nearly all comments, whether supportive or cautious, call for rigorous screening and educational programs to help refugees adapt.  \n  – **Limits on numbers**: Many respondents stress that any increase should be capped to avoid overwhelming local infrastructure.  \n  – **Balance with national welfare**: A recurring concern is ensuring that the needs of U.S. citizens are not neglected while offering refuge.\n\n- **Estimated distribution**  \n  – Approximately 70 % of comments express support (often with conditions).  \n  – Around 20 % oppose or strongly question expanding refugee intake.  \n  – Roughly 10 % remain uncertain or call for a balanced, case‑by‑case approach.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a strong inclination toward compassion and humanitarianism, tempered by realistic concerns about resources, security, and the need for structured policies.",
