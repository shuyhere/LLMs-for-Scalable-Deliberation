    "main_points": "Overall, the comments paint a picture of a field that is rapidly gaining legitimacy while also raising a host of concerns.  \n\n**Supportive views (≈55 %)**  \n- Many respondents see influencer work as a viable, even valuable, profession that offers flexible income, creative freedom, and the chance for ordinary people to reach large audiences.  \n- Influencers are credited with democratizing media, providing alternative news sources, and fostering entrepreneurial spirit.  \n- A number of comments highlight the positive impact of influencers who use their platforms for education, product recommendations, or social causes.  \n\n**Critical views (≈35 %)**  \n- A substantial share express worries about authenticity, transparency, and the potential for misinformation.  \n- Concerns about oversaturation, the “bandwagon” effect, and the loss of originality are common.  \n- Several respondents point to the negative influence on younger audiences—promoting easy money, overconsumption, and discouraging formal education or long‑term career planning.  \n- There is a recurring theme that the profession is poorly regulated and that accountability is lacking.  \n\n**Mixed or nuanced perspectives (≈10 %)**  \n- Some comments acknowledge both the benefits and drawbacks, noting that while influencers can be influential and well‑paid, they also carry significant responsibility toward their audiences.  \n- A few remarks focus on the evolving nature of the industry, calling for better contracts, unions, and media literacy programs to mitigate risks.  \n\nIn short, the consensus is that internet influencing has become a legitimate career path that offers economic opportunities and cultural influence, yet it also introduces challenges related to authenticity, regulation, and societal impact—especially on younger generations. The debate is largely balanced, with a slight lean toward cautious optimism.",
