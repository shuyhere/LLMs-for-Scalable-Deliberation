    "main_points": "**Summary of the deliberation on U.S. refugee policy**\n\n- **General stance**: The majority of respondents favor welcoming refugees fleeing war or persecution. They see it as a moral and humanitarian obligation that reflects the nation’s founding values.\n\n- **Conditions for acceptance**: Almost all supporters emphasize that refugees should be thoroughly vetted, with clear procedures to identify and exclude individuals with criminal histories or who pose security risks. Many also call for limits on the number of arrivals to prevent strain on services.\n\n- **Resource and economic concerns**: A sizable share of participants express worry that the U.S. already bears significant domestic social‑service costs. They argue that the country should first address its own internal problems before expanding refugee intake. Some worry that unchecked intake could negatively affect employment, public services, or overall quality of life for existing citizens.\n\n- **Geographic and demographic considerations**: A few comments highlight that refugees could help alleviate population pressures in rural areas, or that certain regions (e.g., former war zones) might be better suited for resettlement camps. Others note that the benefits of cultural diversity and economic contribution can outweigh potential challenges.\n\n- **Philosophical and historical framing**: Several respondents invoke the U.S.’s history as a refuge for persecuted peoples, framing current policy as a continuation of that legacy. Others stress that humanitarian action should transcend politics, noting the moral duty to protect those facing death or persecution.\n\n- **Opposition**: Those against expansion of refugee policy largely cite resource constraints, potential security risks, and the belief that the U.S. should prioritize its own citizens first. A minority directly question the necessity of U.S. involvement, suggesting that other countries should take on more responsibility.\n\n- **Overall sentiment**: Roughly **70–80 %** of comments lean toward accepting refugees under carefully structured conditions, while **20–30 %** oppose further intake or call for significant restrictions. The dominant narrative is that compassion and humanitarian duty should guide policy, tempered by realistic assessments of capacity and security.",
