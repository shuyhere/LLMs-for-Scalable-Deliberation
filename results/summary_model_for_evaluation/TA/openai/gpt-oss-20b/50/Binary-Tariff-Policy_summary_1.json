    "main_points": "The discussion overwhelmingly leans toward a negative assessment of the current tariff policy.  \n- **Approximately 70 %** of the comments describe adverse effects, emphasizing higher consumer prices, hurt to small businesses, strained trade relationships, and limited short‑term benefits.  \n- **About 20 %** view the tariffs as potentially positive, citing future job creation, increased federal revenue, or strategic protection of domestic industries.  \n- The remaining 10 % express mixed or uncertain outcomes, acknowledging both immediate costs and possible long‑term gains.\n\nKey concerns mentioned by most participants include:\n\n* **Price inflation** – many note that tariffs are passed on to consumers, raising everyday costs.  \n* **Small‑business impact** – several comments highlight how smaller firms feel the burden more acutely.  \n* **Trade relationships** – several observers warn that retaliatory tariffs could damage U.S. standing in global markets.  \n* **Domestic production incentives** – a minority argue that tariffs could encourage reshoring and boost national manufacturing, though they also note the current lack of substantial evidence.\n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that the tariffs are currently harming the U.S. economy and society, with only a minority seeing potential long‑term upside.",
