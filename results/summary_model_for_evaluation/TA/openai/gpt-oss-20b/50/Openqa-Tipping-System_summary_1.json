    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe discussion overwhelmingly critiques the current tipping framework.  \n* **Majority opinion (≈ 70 %)**:  \n  - **Oppose** mandatory or pervasive tipping, citing pressure on customers and the cultural shift toward “tip‑everything.”  \n  - **Call for elimination or substitution** with a fixed service charge (often around 10 %) that is included automatically in the bill.  \n  - **Demand fair wages** for service workers, arguing that tipping is a mechanism that lets employers underpay staff.  \n  - **Suggest design changes** such as an easy “no tip” option on point‑of‑sale screens and limiting tips to full‑service restaurants or those with direct interaction.\n\n* **Supportive but conditional (≈ 20 %)**:  \n  - **Accept tipping** when it reflects genuine, high‑quality service.  \n  - **Advocate for living wages** or higher minimum wages to reduce reliance on tips.  \n  - **Propose modest adjustments** (fixed amounts, optional prompts tied to service levels) to make tipping more predictable and less intrusive.\n\n* **Neutral/moderate (≈ 10 %)**:  \n  - **Focus on practical changes** such as fixed tipping amounts or clearer service‑charge options.  \n  - **Mention European models** or emphasize that tipping should be optional and only for certain service contexts (e.g., dine‑in, not drive‑thru or pickup).\n\nAcross the board, the consensus points to a tipping system that is seen as a workaround for low base wages and an uncomfortable expectation for consumers. The prevailing sentiment is that a shift toward fair, guaranteed wages for service workers—paired with a standardized service charge—would resolve many of the concerns raised.",
