    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nA majority of respondents favor requiring real‑name registration on social media, citing **accountability, reduced harassment, and fewer fake accounts** as key benefits. Those who support the rule often frame it as a safety measure that encourages responsible behaviour and facilitates law‑enforcement investigations when needed.\n\nConversely, a sizable minority oppose the requirement, arguing that it **violates privacy, silences vulnerable voices, and exposes users to risks** such as identity theft, stalking, or government surveillance. Many see anonymity as essential for free expression, especially for people in unsafe or politically sensitive environments.\n\nA smaller group sees the issue as **context‑dependent**. They suggest that the platform, not the government, should decide, or that the rule be optional with privacy safeguards (e.g., private profile settings or verified badges). Some respondents propose a **balanced hybrid approach** that preserves anonymity for the public while allowing verification behind the scenes.\n\n**Key Themes**\n\n| Theme | Percentage of Comments | Representative Points |\n|-------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Privacy concerns** | ~35 % | Fear of data misuse, identity theft, and surveillance |\n| **Accountability & safety** | ~40 % | Reducing bullying, scamming, and bot activity |\n| **Freedom of expression** | ~20 % | Anonymity protects dissent, activism, and marginalized groups |\n| **Conditional support** | ~10 % | Platform‑level enforcement, optional real‑name options, or verification systems |\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects a tension between protecting users from harm and preserving individual privacy and freedom online. The most common resolution is a compromise that keeps anonymity as an option while implementing stronger verification or moderation tools to curb abuse.",
