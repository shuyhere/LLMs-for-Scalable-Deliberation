    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly express concern that cutting academic funding will harm students, educators, and the nation’s future.  \n- **Impact on education**: Most respondents fear that reduced resources will lower the quality of teaching, limit access for low‑income families, and hinder social mobility.  \n- **Research and innovation**: Many note that cuts could stall scientific progress, prompt researchers to move abroad, and diminish the country’s competitive edge.  \n- **Political motives**: A sizable portion criticize the decision as politically driven, accusing the administration of targeting “left‑leaning” institutions or using cuts to control the populace.  \n- **Mixed viewpoints**: A minority see some justification for trimming spending, citing wasteful allocation, or believing that certain academic agendas are undesirable.  \n- **Tone and rhetoric**: The discussion ranges from thoughtful analysis to harsh criticism, with occasional inflammatory or conspiratorial remarks.  \n\nOverall, the prevailing sentiment is that the funding reductions are short‑sighted, detrimental to long‑term progress, and likely to exacerbate existing inequities in the education system.",
