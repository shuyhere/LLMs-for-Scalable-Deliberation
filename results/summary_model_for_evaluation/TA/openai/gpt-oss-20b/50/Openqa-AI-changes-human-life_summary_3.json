    "main_points": "**Overall Summary**\n\nThe comments reveal a strong tendency to view AI as a powerful tool that streamlines everyday tasks, boosts productivity, and expands creative possibilities. A majority appreciate how AI speeds up research, drafting, and editing, and many highlight its role in learning new skills, managing time, and making routine work more efficient. Those who use AI often describe it as a “personal assistant” that can instantly retrieve information, summarize long texts, or generate ideas for projects and hobbies.\n\nAlongside these benefits, several respondents express concerns that outweigh the advantages for them. Privacy and data‑security worries are common, with many feeling that AI tracks personal habits and preferences. Job‑security anxiety is also noted, as some fear that automation could replace human roles. A few participants point to bias or inaccuracies in AI outputs, leading to mistrust of the information provided. There is also a sense of over‑dependence, with some feeling that they rely too heavily on AI for even simple tasks, which they believe could erode critical thinking or originality.\n\nA smaller but visible portion of comments remain neutral or uncertain about AI’s impact, noting that the technology is still new or that they do not use it extensively. Even those who see it largely as a convenience sometimes mention that it has not yet changed their lives in any major way.\n\n**Key Points (in approximate proportion):**\n\n- **Positive Impact (≈70 %)** – Time‑saving, increased efficiency, easier learning, creative support, better organization, and enhanced accessibility to information.\n- **Negative / Cautionary Themes (≈20 %)** – Privacy and data‑security concerns, job‑security fears, bias/inaccuracy, perceived over‑dependence, and loss of trust in online content.\n- **Neutral / Uncertain (≈10 %)** – Limited use, skepticism about long‑term effects, or a view that AI is still too new to have made a meaningful difference.\n\nOverall, while most participants acknowledge significant benefits from AI, a notable minority highlight important ethical, security, and psychological issues that could mitigate or complicate those gains.",
