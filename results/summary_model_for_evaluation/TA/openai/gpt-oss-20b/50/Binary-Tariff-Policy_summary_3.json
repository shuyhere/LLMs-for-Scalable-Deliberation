    "main_points": "The comments overwhelmingly view the current tariff policy as a net negative for the U.S. economy. Roughly seven‑eighths of respondents emphasize higher consumer prices, inflation, and reduced purchasing power, while also citing hurt to small businesses and a weakening of international trade relationships.  \n\nA smaller segment—about one‑fifth—expresses optimism that the tariffs will eventually protect domestic industries, stimulate job creation, and bring in additional tax revenue. Some of these voices note potential long‑term benefits for the federal budget or for specific sectors, but they generally acknowledge short‑term pain.  \n\nThe remaining comments describe the effect as mixed or uncertain, pointing out that tariffs may shield certain industries while simultaneously dampening growth, investment, and global competitiveness.  \n\nAcross the board, the dominant concerns center on consumer costs, the erosion of supply chains, a strain on diplomatic ties—especially with China—and doubts about the ability of U.S. firms to offset the tariffs by reshoring production. Positive comments frequently stress the need for strategic, targeted protectionism and the potential for future gains once the market adjusts. Overall, the prevailing sentiment is that the tariffs currently impose more economic hardship than advantage.",
