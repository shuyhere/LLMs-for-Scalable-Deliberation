Respondents highlight that healthcare is a fundamental right, that it would reduce financial hardship, improve preventive care, and align the United States with other developed nations.\n\n- **Small Opposition**  \n  Roughly **12 %** of the comments oppose extensive government involvement, citing concerns about cost, potential inefficiency, and the belief that the private sector should handle coverage.\n\n- **Very Limited Neutrality**  \n  Only about **2 %** of the comments are tentative or partial, suggesting a scaled‑down approach or a public option alongside private plans.\n\n- **Common Arguments for Support**  \n  1. **Human right** – Health care should be available to all, not a privilege tied to employment or income.  \n  2. **Cost containment** – A single‑payer or basic universal plan could lower overall expenses and reduce medical debt.  \n  3. **Public good** – Universal coverage improves population health and productivity, benefiting the economy and national security.  \n  4. **Equity** – It would eliminate disparities that prevent people from seeking timely care.\n\n- **Common Concerns from Opponents**  \n  1. **Fiscal burden** – Fear that a universal system would be too",
