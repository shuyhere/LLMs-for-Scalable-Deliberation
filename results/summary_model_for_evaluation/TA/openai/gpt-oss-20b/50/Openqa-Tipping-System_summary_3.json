    "main_points": "The discussion shows a clear split around the role of tips in the U.S. economy and dining culture.\n\n**Major concerns**\n\n* **Over‑reliance on tips** – Roughly **two‑thirds** of respondents view the current tipping model as a way for employers to pay workers below a livable wage, and many feel pressured to tip even when service is minimal.  \n* **Consumer discomfort** – About **half** of the comments highlight that the default “tip” prompts on POS systems make it hard to refuse or to choose a lower amount.  \n* **Wage fairness** – Over **half** advocate for a guaranteed living wage for service staff, arguing that tips should be a bonus rather than a base pay.\n\n**Proposed changes**\n\n* **Eliminating or limiting mandatory tips** – Close to **two‑thirds** suggest removing the tip option altogether (or making it optional) and replacing it with a flat service charge or a higher menu price.  \n* **Living‑wage standard** – More than **half** call for a minimum wage that covers service workers’ basic needs, reducing the need for tips.  \n* **Conditional tipping** – Around **one‑third** support keeping tips but only for “full‑service” situations (sit‑down restaurants, exceptional service) and not for quick pickups or drive‑throughs.  \n* **Fixed or simplified tip amounts** – A smaller group (≈10 %) proposes standard fixed tips (e.g., $20 or $30) rather than a percentage.\n\n**Support for the status quo**\n\nOnly a minority (≈10 %) express strong approval of the current system, often noting that tipping can motivate higher service quality and that workers rely on it for income.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe majority feel that tipping, as it currently operates, is an ineffective wage substitute and a source of consumer anxiety. Most propose moving toward a model where service staff receive a reliable base pay, and any additional gratuity is voluntary or tied to a clear service level. A smaller, but vocal, segment insists that tipping should remain but be limited to situations where its purpose—as a reward for exceptional service—is evident.",
